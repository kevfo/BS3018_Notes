Second, they’re useful for studying development and other processes. Third, by looking at plants, one can understand things from genes to whole communities. Lastly, plants matter a lot.\nIn this lecture, there are some important words to remember:\nPlants are incredibly important because life wouldn’t be possible without them. They provide us with essential things we need to survive. Imagine staple foods like rice, wheat, corn, and potatoes – these come from plants and make up a big part of our diets. Even things like fruits, herbs, and spices, like chili, coffee, and chocolate, all come from different types of plants. Each of these plants contributes to the foods we eat and enjoy.\nNowadays, people are getting more worried about having enough food for everyone. That’s why understanding plant biology is super important now. It helps us make sure there’s enough food for everyone.\nIn this week’s session, we’re going to learn about a few things:"

    "section": "1.1 What is a Plant?",
    "text": "1.1 What is a Plant?\nWhen we look at living things, it’s normal to put them into groups based on the things they have in common. People have always done this. In the case of plants, this grouping is called taxonomy. Traditionally, plants were sorted into groups based on what they looked like and how they were different from each other.\nNonetheless, for a long time, scientists have looked at specific traits to understand what makes something a plant. These traits have taught us a couple of important things about plants:\n\nPlants are organisms that use a process called photosynthesis to make their own food. This sets them apart from many other living things.\nThey have a special way of life that involves different stages in their cycle. Sometimes they have a part that’s like a “baby” version (called gametophyte) and another part that’s more grown-up (called sporophyte). This alternation between these two stages is a big part of what makes plants unique.\n\nAs scientists have discovered more about different living things, they’ve had to rethink how they define plants. Organisms that were once thought to belong only to the “Plant Kingdom” have been moved to their own groups, like Fungi. This is because we now know more about their characteristics.\nThe way scientists sort living things has also changed over time. It started with a simple “Two Kingdom” idea, where there were just Plants and Animals. Then it grew to a “Five Kingdom” idea, adding Fungi, Protists, and Bacteria. Now, things have evolved even more into the concept of “Three Domains”: Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria. But what’s really important is that the way scientists classify living things has shifted. Instead of just looking at how things appear, they now focus a lot on the relationships between organisms and how they’ve evolved. This new way of sorting is all about understanding the family tree of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogeny of Plants\n\n\n\n\nDefining plants can be a bit tricky. Some people think of plants as organisms that can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. They also have a special kind of life cycle called “alternation of generations.” However, not every organism with these features belongs to the same group on the tree of life as plants do.\nIn this course, the focus is narrowed down. They will be looking specifically at “green plants.” And to be even more precise, they’ll be studying “Land Plants,” which are also known as “Embryophytes.” These are the plants that live on land and have certain characteristics that set them apart.\n\n1.1.1 Phylogeny versus Classification\nPhylogeny is about showing how different living things are related to each other. It’s like drawing a family tree that connects all the creatures. These family trees not only tell us about relationships but also give clues about the history and environment of different groups of organisms. Plus, they show how organisms have changed over time to fit their surroundings better.\nClassification, on the other hand, is more about giving names and organizing the incredible variety of life. It’s like putting different things into different boxes based on how they look or behave.\nNow, when it comes to plants, their phylogeny helps experts decide how to classify them. By understanding the connections between different plant groups, scientists can figure out the best way to group and name them. It’s like solving a puzzle where the pieces are the relationships between plants.\nIf a plant flowers, it’s called a angiosperm. Otherwise, it’s a gymnosperm."

Moving towards the right, there are filamentous organisms, which are like chains of cells. And on the far right, there’s something called “coenocytic.” This means it’s a big organism with many nuclei, or control centers, inside it. Unlike most organisms that have individual cells, this one doesn’t have clear divisions between its cells inside.\n\n\n1.2.2 Locophytes\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of a Locophyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Gingko Tree\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Gingko Tree’s Seeds\n\n\n\n\nTalking about the Ginkgo, there’s just one type that exists now, called Ginkgo biloba.

Instead, it creates something called spores. These spores are not the same as gametes.\nThese spores grow into a plant that can make gametes. This plant generation is called the gametophyte.\nWhen gametes from different plants come together, they make a cell with two sets again (2N). This cell, called a zygote, then grows into a different kind of plant, the sporophyte, which produces spores.\nSo, in plants, the cycle goes from spores to gametophyte to zygote to Sporophyte and back again. It’s a bit different from what happens in animals."

However, they are responsible for performing metabolism within the plant.\nCollenchyma\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Lignin\n\n\n\n\nThese cells are found in primary tissue, but their cell walls are made of a kind of sugar called cellulose (i.e., not lignin). Cells with a lignified xylem (e.g., fiber and sclerenchyma cells) are usually associated with secondary (and some primary) tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bundle of Celery\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, celery leaves are held up by the celery itself which is made out of collenchyma cells.\n\n\n2.2.1 Silver Cells\nThese are cells that basically move photosynthate (e.g., sugars and whatnot) and are made up of two things: sieve cells and companion cells.\n\n\n2.2.2 Conducting and Vascular Tissue\nThese tissues serve to move water (i.e., the xylem) and other items (i.e., the phloem) around the plant, and each tissue type serves multiple functions.\n\n2.2.2.1 Xylem\nThis tissue is actually made up of many different cells and are entirely made out of dead cells when in its later stages (i.e., when the xylem reaches “maturity”).\nThe xylem also forms one continuous column from the plant’s roots to its leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Cells in the Xylem\n\n\n\n\nThe cells that move water throughout the xylem (i.e., the conducting cells) have two kinds:\n\nTracheids\nThese are narrow cells with tapered ends. All plants that have vascular systems have this.\nVessels\nThese are found in most, but not all flowering plants. These kinds of cells have a larger diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Helianthus Stem\n\n\n\n\nWhen the xylem thickens, it’s mainly because of the secondary xylem (i.e., wood). It grows because of thet vascular cambium.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Other Tissue and Cell Types\nProf. Lum lists some more:\n\nThe bark - this is also called the periderm.\nSclerenchyma - these are made out of something called linear fibers.\nLenticels - these cells exchange air in shoot and root surfaces.\nTrichomes - these are hair-like projections that grow out of the epidermis."

Instead, they show vessel-like elements.\n\n2.3.1 Vascular Tissue in Monocots versus Dicots\nDicotyledonous plants (i.e., dicots) are plants whose seeds have embryos with two things called cotyledons or seedling leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Monocot Stem\n\n\n\n\nMonocotyledonous plants (i.e., monocots), on the contrary, are plants whose seeds have embryos that only have one cotyledon.\nDicot stems have a ring-like formation because of how their vascular tissue are arranged, whereas monocot stems are more scattered.\n\n\n2.3.2 Leaves\nThese plant organs have a stomata and an epidermis, layers, a vascular system (i.e., phloem and xylem), and may even have special layers to them. There’s also a ton of variation among leaves in terms of their shape and function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStoma and Guard Cell of a Tomato Plant’s Leaves\n\n\n\n\nThe epidermis is just the outer layer of plant tissues (i.e., kinda like the outer layer of skin on humans). The stoma - on the other hand - are just the pores in the epidermis of tissues that conduct photosynthesis. The stoma has two cells: a pair of guard cells that are surrounded by subsidiary cells.\n\n2.3.2.1 Venation and Stomata Distribution\nThe organization of vascular tissue and the distribution of stomata differs between monocots and dicots in the following ways:\n\nLeaves in dicot plants have veins that are net-like. Leaves in monocot leaves have veisn that are in parallel structures.\nDifferent stomata distribution patterns reflect the fact that venation is different in monocots and dicots.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Roots versus Shoots\nRoots and shoots differ in terms of how their vascular tissues are arranged. In root tissue, the vascular tissue have protective layers - like an endodermis and a root cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Buttercup’s Root\n\n\n\n\nHowever, root and shoot tissue have something called a zone of maturation. The xylem and the phloem alternate in root tissue (as seen above).\n\n2.3.3.1 Modified Roots\n\n\n\n\n\nModified Roots in a Freshwater Swamp Forest\n\n\n\n\nThese are roots that have been modified to serve a specific purpose other than just anchoring the plant to the ground. The above tree from a swamp is an example."

The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving…”\n– Charles Darwin\n\nIt was through these ideas that he founded the idea of natural selection - in a nutshell, these are:\n\nIndividuals vary\nSome of these variations in 1. are rooted in genetics.\nThere’s a tendency for the population of a species to grow exponentially.\nThese variations in 1. may affect the ability of individuals to survive - this is called their fitness: their ability to survive and reproduce.\nIndividuals that have favorable variations are live and reproduce - we say that these individuals are naturally selected.\n\nFor the man himself, Ecology was the meat of his natural selection idea. If there was nothing that to make surviving difficult, then there would be no reason for individuals to have different fitnesses and therefore, also nothing to make natural selection happen."

This absorbed energy is then relayed to where photosynthesis actually occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nTwo pigments - chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b - are used to capture light in photosynthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Harvesting Complexes in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nAt least in the memrbane protein LHCII, the said pigments are arranged into a sort of antennae. Scientists think that each 25 kDa protein above binds 14 chlorophylls and also four things called xanthophylls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessory Light-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, pigments called accessory pigments can help pick up light that are otherwise not absorbed by chlorophyll. Because of this, photosynthesis is able to become more efficient as these pigments can also transmit the energy to where photosynthesis happens.\nThe cool thing about these pigments too is that they help protect organisms against intense or damaging sunlight.\n\n4.2.1.1 Absorbing Light\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Light Absorption Works\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is absorbed, this causes a molecule to become “excited” and go to a higher energy state.\nThe difference between this “excited” and normal state is referred to as \\(\\Delta E\\) - the difference can be calculated using:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light absorbed.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Energy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\nWhen an electron is excited inside the chlorophyll, the following actions can happen:\n\nFluorescence\nHere, an excited electron releases a photon and returns to its original state.\nReturning to the Ground State\nWhen this happens, energy that the electron has is lost as heat to the environment.\nEnergy Transfer\nThe energy that was lost as heat is then taken up by another electron\nPhotochemistry\nThis loss in energy causes chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Where is Light Absorbed?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations of Light Absorption\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is captured, it is captured on the antennae before this light energy is sent to the reaction centers.\nProf. Oliver also lists a few terminology:\n\nPhotosystem\nThis is a structure that is made out of a reaction center (i.e., RC) and an antenna or light harvesting complex.\nReaction Center (i.e., RC)\nThese help convert light energy turn into chemical energy. These are also just protein bits (i.e., subunits) that have things called cofactors attached to them that are found in the middle of the photosystem.\nAntenna or light harvesting complexes\nThese structures have chlorophyll and other accessory pigments; they surround the RC and help absorb light and sent it to the RC.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Charge Separation\nOnce pigments absorb energy, this energy needs to be sent over in a way called resonance energy transfer. What this basically means is that after the light energy goes from the antennae to the reaction center, an electron is transferred over to the membrane and to a donor, and this causes something called photoinduced charge separation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge Separation in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason this is possible is because electron transfer is a lot faster (i.e, 3 ps).\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Kinds of Photosystems in Oxygenic Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThat said, there are also two kinds of photosystems in oxygenic photosystems. These two kinds of photosystems are related to the way that prokaryotes perform anoxygenic photosynthesis.\n\n\n4.2.3 Electron Transfer\nThis step moves electrons across a chain to do two things: to make a proton motive force and to also make NADPH.\nAll electron transfer reactions involve something called oxidation reduction reactions. In the case of the equation for photosynthesis:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  6CO_2 + 12H_2O \\stackrel{\\text{light}}{\\longrightarrow} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe reducer (i.e., reducing species) is the water molecule H2O and one to become oxidized is the carbon dioxide (i.e., the CO2).\nWe use the symbol \\(\\Delta G\\) to illustrate the tendency of redox reactions to proceed. This symbol is also called the free energy.\n\n4.2.3.1 Free Energy and Redox Potentials\nThe value of \\(\\Delta G\\) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta G = -nF\\Delta E^\\theta\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe higher the potential that something has, this means that it is a great reducing agent. This also means that this something also has a greater tendency to accept electrons (and vice versa).\nHence, electrons will willing flow from substances with low tendencies to accept electrons to substances with high tendencies for electrons."

The cycle does three things:\n\nCombine carbon dioxide (i.e., CO2) with a sugar called ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (i.e., RuBP) to form two three-carbon intermediary products: 3-phosphoglycerate (i.e., 3PGA).\nReduce 3PGA to form something called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (i.e., G3P).\nRemake RuBP.\n\nIn short, we can summarize the Calvin cycle using this chemical equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  &3CO_2 + 5H_2O + 6 NADPH + 9 ATP \\stackrel{\\text{Rubisco and other enzymes}}{\\longrightarrow} \\\\\n  &G3P + 3H^+ + 6NADP^+ + 9 ADP + 8P_i\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n5.1.1 What is Rubisco?\nThis is an enzyme that many scientists want to know more about.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco’s Action\n\n\n\n\nThe enzyme rubisco - short for “Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase” - is responsible for turning one molecule of RuBP into two molecules of 3PGA.\nWhat’s interesting is that rubisco is the most common protein on Earth, but this enzyme often takes the most time to do its job in the dark portion of photosynthesis. Though, what’s also interesting is that there are more efficient enzymes than the Rubisco that crops have.\n\n\n5.1.2 Stages of Calvin Cycle\nThis cycle has three main stages:\n\nReduction\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction Portion of Calvin Cycle\n\n\n\n\nIn this portino of the cycle, there’s an enzyme called 3PGA Kinase.

    "section": "5.2 Rubisco",
    "text": "5.2 Rubisco\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nRubisco is like a big protein (i.e., around 550 kDa) with eight large parts (i.e., LSU) and eight small parts (i.e., SSU), making a total of 16 parts. These LSU parts form pairs called dimers, and each dimer has two special spots for chemical reactions (i.e., the stars). These spots are made up of different parts of the LSU. All Rubiscos have these same spots.\nThese dimers group together to form an eight-part core (i.e., L8). Around this core, there are eight small subunits (SSUs), split into two groups – one at the top and one at the bottom of the core. The core’s full activity depends on these SSU parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco as a Bifunctional Enzyme\n\n\n\n\nApart from its main job of adding CO2 to RuBP, Rubisco can also do something else. It can work with O2 and attach it to RuBP. However, this oxygen part is like a competitor to the carbon dioxide. They look alike and behave in a similar way, so sometimes oxygen gets in the way of CO2 doing its job.\n\n5.2.1 Activation with CO2 and Mg2+\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a special spot in all Rubisco large subunits called Lys 201, which plays a crucial role. It helps CO2 slowly stick to it, forming something called a carbamate (EC). This CO2 that sticks here is like an “activator” and is different from the CO2 used for the main job of fixing carbon with RuBP.\nTo make sure this carbamate is stable, it needs the help of magnesium ions (Mg2+). When these ions quickly attach to the active site, it makes the spot ready for the actual chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n5.2.2 Photorespiration\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotorespiration by Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nWhen Rubisco uses oxygen instead of carbon dioxide to work with RuBP, it’s not very efficient. This is considered wasteful because it requires a lot of energy and resources to fix the mistakes that happen during this process. It takes up energy (ATP) and some other important stuff, and it even loses some of the carbon dioxide that was supposed to be captured.\nThis problem with Rubisco’s preference for oxygen over carbon dioxide (called CO2 / O2 specificity) affects how efficiently plants can use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. It determines whether carbon gets used for making sugars in the Calvin cycle (good) or gets lost in a less useful process called photorespiration (not so good).\n\n\n5.2.3 Catalysis\nRubisco manages five different steps during catalysis, and each of these steps is complex enough that it would typically need its own enzyme to get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalysis by Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nHowever, alongside its main job, Rubisco sometimes gets sidetracked into unproductive side reactions, shown in blue. These side reactions aren’t helpful; they can either create compounds that inhibit Rubisco’s own function (like XuBP) or decrease the amount of a useful product called 3-PGA that should be produced. These side distractions reduce the overall efficiency of Rubisco’s work.\n\n\n5.2.4 Rubisco is Inefficient\nRubisco isn’t good at capturing carbon dioxide. There are a few reasons for this:\n\nAbortive Side Reactions\nRubisco sometimes gets distracted by unproductive side reactions.\nLow Specificity for CO2\nIt isn’t very picky and often mistakes oxygen for carbon dioxide.\nSlow Working Speed\nRubisco works quite slowly, with a turnover rate of about one to two reactions per second in real-life conditions.\n\nBecause of these limitations, plants have to invest a lot of their resources into Rubisco to make sure they can capture enough carbon dioxide to grow effectively.\n\n5.2.4.1 Overcoming Rubisco’s Inefficiency\nRubisco plays a significant role in how much water a leaf needs to let evaporate to get carbon dioxide. This is called the transpiration ratio. In tobacco, for instance, this ratio is usually around 500 to 1000, but it can change depending on factors like light, temperature, and humidity.\nThe efficiency of Rubisco directly affects this transpiration ratio, especially when there isn’t much carbon dioxide around. If Rubisco works better (meaning it can work faster and is better at picking carbon dioxide over oxygen), it allows the leaf to do its job with less carbon dioxide. As a result, the leaf can close its stomatal pores a bit to reduce water loss while still getting enough carbon dioxide for photosynthesis."

This protein’s job is to clean up any mess left behind by inhibitory sugar-phosphate molecules. These inhibitory molecules can come from natural processes or the side reactions we talked about earlier.\nRubisco activase works by interacting with Rubisco’s big structures and using energy from ATP to get rid of these sugar-phosphate molecules that are stuck to Rubisco’s active sites - E, EC, or ECM. This cleaning process allows Rubisco to get back to work, so it can do its job of capturing carbon dioxide and helping with photosynthesis.\n\n5.3.1 Structure of Rubisco Activase\nRubisco activase is a protein that’s relatively small, measuring about 42 to 46 kDa. In some plants, there are two slightly different versions of this protein due to alternative splicing of the same genetic instructions. These variations mainly differ in the length of their tail-end.\nFor Rubisco activase to do its job properly, six of these protein molecules need to come together and form a circular hexamer complex. This arrangement was only figured out in 2011, after 20 years of research.\nInterestingly, the 46 kDa version of Rubisco activase has some cysteine residues in its tail-end. These cysteine parts are important because they allow its activity to be regulated by a system involving ferredoxin and thioredoxin."

These enzymes don’t work at full speed all the time; their activity is actually controlled by light.\nThis control happens through something called the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. It’s like a link that connects the light absorbed by the thylakoid membranes to the performance of these enzymes in the stroma, the fluid inside the chloroplasts. So, when there’s light, these enzymes can work better, which is important for photosynthesis.\nWhen light is present, what happens is that there’s more magnesium and less H+ ions, and this helps activate FBPase, SBPase, PRK, and Rubisco.\n\n5.4.1 Why Regulate the Calvin Cycle?\nRunning the Calvin cycle just right is super important. It needs to go at a pace that matches the current conditions, like how much sunlight there is. Also, the amounts of different substances within the cycle need to stay balanced. If the cycle goes too fast or slow at different points, it can mess things up by storing too much of some substances and causing problems.\nGetting out of the cycle also has to be carefully managed. If not enough triose phosphates are taken out, it causes a buildup of certain sugars, and there won’t be enough phosphate for making ATP. On the other hand, if too much is removed, we can’t use the energy and reducing power produced during the light reactions effectively. So, it’s crucial to strike the right balance."

This forms another 4-carbon acid, like malate or aspartate.\nTransport to Bundle Sheath Cells\nThese 4-carbon acids are then moved to the bundle sheath cells.\nDecarboxylation\nIn the bundle sheath cells, these 4-carbon acids are transformed to release CO2 and a 3-carbon acid.\nCO2 Fixation\nThis released CO2 is captured by Rubisco in the bundle sheath cells through the Calvin cycle.\nTransport Back to Mesophyll Cells\nThe 3-carbon acid product goes back to the mesophyll cells to make more PEP, and the cycle continues.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Favorable Characteristics in C4 Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco Content in C3 and C4 Plants\n\n\n\n\nC4 plants have a clever way of concentrating carbon dioxide near Rubisco, the enzyme that helps with photosynthesis. This has some important benefits. It reduces the chance of Rubisco mistakenly using oxygen, which is a good thing because it lowers the rate of photorespiration.\nAdditionally, these plants don’t need as much Rubisco, which is a protein, because they have higher Vcmax rates. This makes them better at using nitrogen efficiently. Also, they use bicarbonate (HCO3-) as their main source of carbon, and this doesn’t lead to oxygenation like CO2 can. Because of this, C4 plants can operate with lower levels of CO2 inside their cells. This means they can have smaller stomata openings, which helps them use water more efficiently compared to C3 plants.\n\n\n5.5.3 CAM Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nCAM Photosynthesis Overview\n\n\n\n\nCAM photosynthesis is a kind of photosynthesis that happens and is regulated by phosphorylation instead of light.\nCAM photosynthesis is used by plants that live in dry places like succulents (such as cacti) and some tropical plants like orchids. The way they capture carbon dioxide is quite similar to C4 plants. However, CAM plants do something interesting. Instead of separating the two steps of capturing CO2 in different parts of the plant, they do it at different times of the day.\nOne notable thing about CAM plants is how they control the opening and closing of their stomata, the tiny pores on their leaves. Unlike most plants that open stomata during the day and close them at night, CAM plants do the opposite. They open their stomata at night and close them during the day. This helps them save water, which is crucial in dry environments.\nHowever, there’s a trade-off. Because CAM plants can’t store as much of the substances they make as other plants, they don’t grow as much biomass each day."

    "text": "Examples of Plant Hormones\nPlant hormones are like tiny messengers inside plants. They come in many different forms but are usually very small molecules. Even though they’re tiny, they have big jobs and work at really low levels. These hormones often travel from one part of the plant to another to deliver their messages. They’re like the plant’s way of sending signals.\nWhen these hormones reach their target, they make things happen. They can cause the plant to change how certain genes work. It’s kind of like flipping switches inside the plant to turn on or off different processes. These hormones do two main jobs:\nPlant hormone biology is really interesting to us humans for several reasons. One big reason is that the way plant hormones work, or sometimes don’t work, can have a big impact on agriculture. For example, there’s a hormone called ethylene that helps fruits ripen. Understanding how this hormone works can help us control when fruits ripen, which is essential for managing harvests.\nWe’ve also learned that we can use plant hormones to get the responses we want from plants. For instance, we can use hormones to make fruits ripen faster or delay the shedding of leaves. This kind of control is essential in agriculture.\nIn our efforts to breed plants for better qualities, we’ve noticed something interesting. Many of the plants we’ve bred for things like higher yields don’t produce or respond to hormones as effectively as wild plants. This is because what nature has selected for (survival in tough environments) isn’t always what we want (maximum production in controlled conditions). So, understanding how plant hormones work can help us create plants with the qualities we desire."

    "text": "6.1 Auxin\n\n\n\n\n\nDarwin and Sons’s Classic Experiments\n\n\n\n\nDarwin and his son made an interesting discovery about how plants respond to light. They found that the signal telling a plant to grow towards the light comes from the very tip of the shoot where it senses the light. But here’s the fascinating part – this signal doesn’t just stay at the tip. It travels down the shoot and affects what happens further down.\nThey also found that if you put something that water can’t pass through as a barrier, like a waterproof layer, it can stop this signal. But here’s an odd twist – if you use something like gelatin, which water can pass through, it doesn’t stop the signal.\n\n6.1.1 Polar Transport\n\n\n\n\n\nPolar Transport of Auxin\n\n\n\n\nAuxin is a special hormone in plants, and it moves around in a pretty interesting way. It doesn’t just float around randomly; it’s transported through special cells in the xylem called parenchyma cells. This method is faster than just spreading by diffusion, which is how things usually move in and out of cells.\nNow, here’s something unique about auxin: it always travels from the shoot (the upper part of the plant) to the root (the lower part), which is called basipetal transport. This one-way journey is possible thanks to specific proteins called PIN proteins. They act like precise carriers that ensure auxin goes in the right direction.\nWhen auxin enters a cell, it does so as an uncharged molecule called IAAH. But then, it gets trapped when it loses a proton and becomes IAA-. These charged forms of auxin are carried by a protein called AUX1.\nThe only way auxin can leave the cell is through other PIN carriers, but they’re located only on the basal side (the bottom part) of the cell. This setup makes auxin move in a specific direction, which is called polar transport. It’s worth noting that auxin is the only hormone that travels in this polar way in plants.\n\n\n6.1.2 What Does Auxin Do?\nAuxin, also known as IAA-, is like the conductor of a plant’s orchestra because it influences so many things.\nFirstly, it’s responsible for tropism, which is how plants move in response to their environment. For example, when a plant bends towards the light, it’s auxin that’s encouraging the cells to grow longer on one side, making the plant bend.\nIn terms of plant development, auxin plays a big role in something called apical dominance. This means it tells the plant not to grow branches from its main shoot until it’s ready. If you remove the main shoot, then the axillary buds can start growing. It also encourages more branching in the roots and helps fruits develop, especially when it’s produced in the seeds.\n\n\n6.1.3 Ubiquitin-Proteasome System\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkings of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System\n\n\n\n\nInside plant cells, there’s a crucial system called the Ubiquitin-Proteasome system, and it plays a significant role in how several plant hormones work.\nNow, here’s how it operates: In all cells, not just plant cells, there are proteins that need to be broken down when they’re no longer needed. This system marks these proteins for destruction by attaching a small molecule called ubiquitin to certain parts of the protein.\nTo identify which proteins need to be broken down, there’s a complex called E3 ubiquitin ligase. Think of it like a team leader. It uses something called an F-box protein to find the protein that needs to be broken down and position it properly for the ubiquitin molecule to attach.\nOnce the target protein is in the right position, an enzyme called E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme helps to add the ubiquitin molecule to the target protein. This marks it for destruction by the proteasome, which acts like a cell’s recycling center.\n\n\n6.1.4 Mechanisms of Auxin\nAuxin, a vital plant hormone, has various effects on plant growth, but it operates through an ancient and unified mechanism.\n\nNormally, genes that respond to auxin are switched off. This happens because a repressor protein (AUX/IAA) teams up with auxin response factors (ARFs).\nAuxin acts like a kind of glue. It brings together the repressor protein and another protein called TIR1, which is part of a larger complex called E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCF).\nOnce this complex forms, the repressor protein is marked for destruction by the ubiquitin proteasome system. When it’s broken down, the genes that respond to auxin can be turned on, and the plant can start doing what auxin is telling it to do.\n\nNow, here’s an interesting twist: there are different versions or isoforms of TIR1, AUX/IAA, and ARF proteins. Depending on which isoforms are present, auxin can produce various effects in the plant. This means that the same hormone can have different outcomes based on the specific combination of proteins involved. To understand these complex interactions, scientists use systems biology approaches to reveal how plants respond to auxin in different ways."

The step that determines how fast they’re made is controlled by an enzyme called Isopentenyltransferase (IPT).\nNow, where these cytokinins are made isn’t entirely clear, but we do know that some of them are produced in the roots and then travel up the plant through the xylem, which is like the plant’s plumbing system.\nWhen it’s time for these hormones to stop working, another enzyme called cytokinin oxidase (CKX) comes into play. It deactivates the cytokinins. So, these hormones are kind of like messengers in the plant, and when their job is done, CKX turns them off.\n\n6.2.1 Antagonism Between Cytokinins and Auxins\nCytokinins, which are important plant hormones, were actually discovered when scientists were working on tissue culture, a method for growing plants in a lab. They found a substance called kinetin, which is a product of DNA breakdown, could make plant cells grow into callus (a type of tissue).\nNow, when it comes to plant growth, the balance between auxin and cytokinin matters a lot. If there’s a lot of auxin and not much cytokinin around, the plant tends to form roots. On the other hand, if there’s plenty of cytokinin but less auxin, the plant leans toward making shoots (the upper parts of the plant). So, it’s like a seesaw: more auxin tips the balance toward root formation, while more cytokinin tips it toward shoot formation.\n\n6.2.1.1 What about in Plants?\n\n\n\n\n\nLabelled Plant Anatomy\n\n\n\n\nIn plants, cytokinin and auxin have different effects in different parts of the plant.\nIn the shoot, cytokinin encourages cell division in the apical meristem, which is like the plant’s growth center at the tip. On the other hand, auxin stops the development of side shoots called axillary buds.\nIn the root, it’s a bit like they switch roles. Cytokinin puts the brakes on cell division, while auxin actually encourages it.\nHere’s a bit of a technical explanation: The balance between these hormones depends on a protein called AUX/IAA, with one specific type called SHY2 being important. Cytokinin makes more of this protein, while auxin breaks it down. SHY2 then controls other processes by regulating the expression of certain proteins. It dampens the expression of PIN proteins, which affect how auxin is transported, and it boosts the production of IPT, which is needed for cytokinin production. So, these two hormones work in harmony but differently depending on the plant part and the levels of these proteins.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Decreasing Leaf Senescence\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of Tobacco Plants\n\n\n\n\nScientists conducted an interesting experiment with tobacco plants. They engineered these plants to produce more of a hormone called cytokinin, which is crucial for plant growth, especially in stressful conditions like drought.\nThe exciting part is that these engineered tobacco plants became much more resilient to drought. One reason for this was that they didn’t go through leaf senescence - the aging and wilting of leaves - as quickly when they lacked water.\nThis experiment teaches us a valuable lesson: in some situations, the way plants naturally respond to stress, like by aging and wilting, might not be ideal for agriculture. But the good news is that we can use genetic engineering to change how plants respond to stress, making them better suited for farming. So, it’s a bit like giving plants a superpower to withstand tough conditions.\n\n\n6.2.3 How do Cytokinins Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nInner Workings of Cytokinins\n\n\n\n\nCytokinin communicates with plant cells through a unique signaling pathway known as a phosphorelay two-component system.\nHere’s how it works:\n\nCytokinin attaches to a receptor on the outside of the cell.\nThis binding activates a kind of “messenger” within the cell called a histidine kinase.\nThe histidine kinase transfers a phosphate molecule (Pi) to a receiver domain within the cell and then to a soluble phosphotransfer protein.\nThis phosphotransfer protein travels into the cell’s nucleus, the control center of the cell, where it triggers a series of additional phosphorylation events. These events lead to changes in gene expression, essentially instructing the cell on what to do.\n\nIt’s crucial to understand that cytokinin alters gene regulation, but it does so through a completely different mechanism compared to auxin, showing the incredible diversity of how hormones can influence plant growth and development."

    "text": "6.3 Gibberelins\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Gibberlins\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a family of compounds found in plants, and although there are many of them (a whopping 136), not all are active.\nThese compounds are made through something called the terpenoid pathway, which is like a recipe for creating these molecules.\nNow, what do they do? Well, they play important roles in promoting plant growth and encouraging seeds to sprout. So, you can think of them as the plant’s way of saying, “Let’s grow and get those seeds going!”\n\n6.3.1 Gibberlein Causes Plant Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants With and Without Gibberelic Acid\n\n\n\n\nThe story of gibberellic acid (GA) is pretty interesting. It was first discovered by Japanese scientists in the 1930s. They found that a fungus produced this compound, and when it got on rice plants, it made them grow super fast and tall. However, they grew so fast that they couldn’t support their own weight, and they fell over. This problem was humorously named foolish seedling disease.\nBut here’s the twist: it wasn’t until the 1950s that scientists realized GA is something that plants naturally produce inside themselves.\nNow, here’s why GA is important: when plants have mutations in the genes responsible for making or responding to GA, they end up looking like dwarfs. Their stems are short and sturdy, which is actually a good thing in agriculture. These sturdy stems are better at holding up the big, heavy seeds produced by crop plants. So, GA helps plants grow, but it can also be controlled to create more manageable and productive crops.\n\n\n6.3.2 How do Gibberelins Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Gibberelins Function\n\n\n\n\nGibberellic acid (GA) has a unique way of working inside plant cells:\n\nThere’s a special soluble receptor protein called GID1 that grabs onto GA when it’s around.\nThis GID1-GA duo then latches onto another protein called DELLA, which is like a stop sign for GA’s effects. DELLA is a negative regulator, meaning it slows down GA’s actions.\nNow, the GID1-GA-DELLA trio comes across an F-Box protein in a group known as E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCF). This F-Box protein adds multiple ubiquitin tags to the DELLA protein. These tags act like a “dispose of” label, targeting the DELLA protein for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system, essentially breaking it down.\nOnce DELLA is out of the picture, genes that were previously repressed by DELLA are free to be expressed. It’s like removing a roadblock, allowing these genes to carry out their functions. So, GA indirectly controls gene expression by getting rid of DELLA proteins when it’s time for those genes to be active.\n\nIn both cases - for auxins and gibberelin, the F-box protein shown in the above image is different. It’s TIR1 in auxin as opposed to SLY1 and SNE1 here.\n\n\n6.3.3 Green Revolution Plants\nThe “green revolution” in the 1960s was a game-changer for agriculture. It led to massive increases in crop yields, mainly because of two things: the use of semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat, and the application of more fertilizers.\nNow, here’s where gibberellic acid (GA) comes into play. In recent years, scientists have discovered that GA plays a crucial role in this agricultural transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Green Revolution Plants\n\n\n\n\nIn rice, there’s a gene called sd1 (semi-dwarf 1). This gene encodes an enzyme that’s involved in the production of GA. When there’s less active GA around because of mutations in this gene, rice plants grow shorter, which is actually a good thing because they are less likely to fall over, and they can support more grains.\nIn wheat, there’s a gene called rht (reduced height). This gene encodes a DELLA protein, and this protein is typically broken down in the presence of GA, allowing plants to grow tall. But in some semi-dwarf wheat varieties, the DELLA protein can’t be degraded as it should. This messes up GA signaling and results in shorter wheat plants, which again is beneficial for agriculture because they are sturdier and can handle the weight of their grains better.\nSo, it turns out that GA and genes related to it have been key players in the success of the “green revolution” and the increased productivity of crops."

They were actually discovered when scientists were looking for substances that promote growth in plants.\nThese steroids are made through a pathway called the terpenoid pathway, sort of like a recipe for their production.\nThey play a crucial role in plant development. When there are mutations in the genes responsible for making these steroids, plants end up looking dwarfed or smaller than usual. So, you can think of brassinosteroids as important hormones that help plants grow and develop properly.\n\n6.4.1 How do Brassinosteroids Work?\nBrassinosteroids, these plant steroid hormones, work through a pretty interesting process involving some key players.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Simplified Mechanism Behind Brassinosteroids\n\n\n\n\nFirst, there’s a receptor called BRI1 that’s attached to the cell’s membrane. When there’s no signal telling the plant to grow, a kinase protein called BIN2 comes into play. This kinase does a little chemical handshake with some transcription factors, essentially making them inactive.\nBut when the plant receives the signal that it’s time to grow, like when brassinosteroids are present, a whole series of chemical reactions happen. This leads to the deactivation of BIN2. When BIN2 is inactive, it can’t mess with those transcription factors anymore, so they become active, which means they’re ready to get to work.\n\n\n6.4.2 Signalling in Membranes and Endosomes\nWhen brassinosteroids send their growth signal to a plant cell, a cool thing happens through a process called endocytosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nEndosomes Formed from Endocytosis\n\n\n\n\nEndocytosis creates tiny structures called endosomes, and these little compartments contain the receptors BRI1 and BAK1. These endosomes then travel around inside the cell’s cytoplasm and continue to send signals.\nThis is pretty neat because it means that even parts of the cell membrane far away from the cell’s central command (the nucleus) can still get the message to grow.\nAnd here’s the bonus: the receptors aren’t wasted. After they’ve done their job, they get recycled back to the cell membrane, ready to catch the next growth signal that comes their way. So, it’s like they’re good at their job and eco-friendly too!"

    "text": "6.5 Ethylenes\nEthylene is a gas that has a special role in making fruits ripe and ready to eat. It’s like the plant’s way of saying, “I’m ready to be delicious!”\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowers Treated With and Without Ethylene\n\n\n\n\nEthylene also has another job. It promotes things like leaf shedding (called abscission) and the natural aging of flowers (flower senescence).\n\n\n\n\n\nRipening of Tomatoes Due to Ethylene\n\n\n\n\nIn farming and food storage, ethylene is used to speed up the ripening of fruits. Think of it like a fruit fast-forward button. But if you want to slow things down, you can store fruit in an environment with lots of carbon dioxide (CO2), which reduces ethylene production and slows down the ripening process.\nAnd here’s a cool trick: scientists have found ways to delay flower aging by using substances like sodium thiosulphate and diazocyclopentadiene. These chemicals bind to the ethylene receptor, kind of like putting a lock on it, so it can’t do its job and make the flowers age as quickly. So, ethylene is like the conductor of the plant’s symphony of ripening and aging, and we can fine-tune its effects to our advantage in agriculture.\n\n6.5.1 How does Ethylene Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nEthylene Signalling Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nWhen there’s no ethylene around, a protein called CTR steps in. It binds to the ethylene receptor and starts a process where other molecules get tagged with little phosphate groups in a cascade of chemical reactions. This tagging, called phosphorylation, acts like a “do not disturb” sign for transcription, which is the process of making proteins based on the instructions in genes.\nBut when ethylene comes into the picture and binds to the receptor, it’s like a key that unlocks CTR from the receptor. This release of CTR allows transcription to happen. So, in simple terms, ethylene acts as a switch that turns on the process of making proteins based on certain genes."

    "text": "6.6 Abscisic Acid (i.e. ABA)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Abscisic Acid\n\n\n\n\nAbscisic acid (ABA) is like the sleepytime hormone for plants. It’s made through a process called the terpenoid pathway.\nOne of its main jobs is to tell seeds it’s time to take a nap, or in other words, establish seed dormancy. This dormancy helps seeds survive until they’re in the right conditions to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants Wilting Under the Hot Sun\n\n\n\n\nBut ABA also has another important role. It works as a signal during stressful times in a plant’s life. When things like drought or extreme temperatures happen, ABA steps in and tells the plant to slow down its growth and conserve water.\n\n6.6.1 Seed Dormancy by ABA and GA\nIn some maize mutants lacking ABA (abscisic acid), something interesting happens – they become viviparous, which means their seeds start to sprout even before they leave the parent plant.\nABA usually acts like a “do not disturb” sign for seeds, preventing them from germinating prematurely. But when ABA is missing, seeds can’t resist the urge to sprout.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorn Kernels Under the Influence of Abscisic Acid\n\n\n\n\nTo break seed dormancy and allow germination to happen, a hormone called gibberellic acid (GA) steps in. But here’s the catch: GA and ABA are like rivals. They work against each other. The balance between these two hormones controls whether a seed stays dormant or starts to grow.\nIn fact, GA is so good at making seeds sprout that it’s used by the brewing industry to help barley seeds germinate for beer production. So, you can think of ABA and GA as the plant’s internal seesaw, deciding when it’s time for seeds to wake up and grow.\n\n\n6.6.2 ABA Production Under Stress\n\n\n\n\n\nABA Content Under Water Deprivation\n\n\n\n\nWhen a plant faces a drought, it goes into high gear to produce more ABA (abscisic acid). ABA is like the plant’s superhero in times of drought.\nWhen ABA levels are high, it sends a signal to the stomata, which are tiny openings in the leaves. These stomata are responsible for breathing, but they also let out water through a process called transpiration. High ABA levels act like a traffic cop, telling the stomata to close up shop and reduce water loss. It’s the plant’s way of saying, “We need to conserve water right now!”\nInterestingly, ABA isn’t just made in the leaves; the roots can produce it too. And when the roots make ABA, it can travel up to the leaves through the xylem, like a plant’s internal communication system.\nNow, here’s something cool: there are some mutants, often called wilty, that can’t make ABA. These plants can only thrive in humid conditions because they can’t effectively conserve water during droughts.\nScientists have been trying to figure out how ABA does its superhero job, and they’ve proposed a bunch of candidates for the ABA receptor – like who ABA talks to in the plant cells. But it’s a bit of a mystery, and there’s still some debate among scientists about the exact details."

    "text": "6.7 Jasmonic Acid\nWhen a plant gets nibbled on by hungry insects that chew on its leaves, it doesn’t just sit there and take it. It fights back! This defense mechanism is called “induced defense.”\nOne of the superheroes behind this defense is a hormone called Jasmonic acid, or JA for short. Within just 30 minutes of a plant getting nibbled, the levels of JA shoot up like a rocket.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Jasmonic Acid\n\n\n\n\nJA is like the general of the plant’s army. It signals the plant to activate a bunch of genes that are all about defense. These genes kickstart processes like making special chemicals (secondary metabolism) and producing proteins that mess with the digestion of the herbivores (think of them as plant bodyguards, like bouncers at a club). These proteins are called protease inhibitors.\n\n6.7.1 How is Jasmonic Acid Made?\n\n\n\n\n\nBiosynthesis of Jasmonic Acid\n\n\n\n\nMaking Jasmonic acid (JA) in plants is a bit like a treasure hunt spread across different parts of the plant.\nIt all starts with linolenic acid, which is a type of fat found in the plant’s cell membranes. This linolenic acid is like a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered.\nBut to turn this treasure into active JA, there’s a crucial step. JA needs to team up with an amino acid called isoleucine. This partnership is what makes JA bioactive, like unlocking its superpowers.\nBut here’s the cool part: JA doesn’t just stay in one spot. It moves throughout the plant using a special plant highway called the phloem. It travels to different parts of the plant and tells them, “Hey, we’re under attack, gear up for defense!” So, it’s not just a local response; it’s a whole-plant response to keep those leaf-chomping insects at bay.\n\n\n6.7.2 JA Signalling\nThe way Jasmonic acid (JA) signals in plants is like a secret handshake club. It’s surprisingly similar to how another hormone called auxin signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nJA Signalling Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how it works: JA gets a makeover and becomes JA-Ile, which is like a secret code. JA-Ile acts like a special glue, helping a JAZ repressor protein attach to an F-box protein called COI1, which is part of a complex known as the E3 ubiquitin ligase.\nOnce the JAZ repressor is stuck to COI1, it’s tagged with a label called ubiquitin, like a “kick me” sign. Then, it’s sent to the proteasome, which is like the plant’s recycling center. There, the JAZ repressor gets broken down into its building blocks.\nWith the JAZ repressor out of the way, the plant can finally turn on the genes it needs for defense or other important tasks. It’s like opening the gates for action in the plant’s superhero squad.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide by Side Comparison of Auxin and JA Signalling Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nNo matter which hormone we’re talking about, when it binds to its special receptor, it sets off a chain reaction. This reaction sends a repressor (a bit like a traffic cop) to a special E3 ubiquitin ligase complex known as SCF. This complex is like a control center.\nOnce the repressor gets to SCF, it’s like a green light for destruction. SCF tags the repressor with a label called ubiquitin, and off it goes to the plant’s recycling center, the proteasome. There, the repressor gets broken down into its basic parts.\nNow, what makes these hormones so amazing is that, even though they use this similar method to silence the repressor, they each have their own unique jobs and effects in the plant. So, whether it’s about growth, defense, or some other important task, each hormone has its own special mission."
