Second, they’re useful for studying development and other processes. Third, by looking at plants, one can understand things from genes to whole communities. Lastly, plants matter a lot.\nIn this lecture, there are some important words to remember:\nPlants are incredibly important because life wouldn’t be possible without them. They provide us with essential things we need to survive. Imagine staple foods like rice, wheat, corn, and potatoes – these come from plants and make up a big part of our diets. Even things like fruits, herbs, and spices, like chili, coffee, and chocolate, all come from different types of plants. Each of these plants contributes to the foods we eat and enjoy.\nNowadays, people are getting more worried about having enough food for everyone. That’s why understanding plant biology is super important now. It helps us make sure there’s enough food for everyone.\nIn this week’s session, we’re going to learn about a few things:"

    "section": "1.1 What is a Plant?",
    "text": "1.1 What is a Plant?\nWhen we look at living things, it’s normal to put them into groups based on the things they have in common. People have always done this. In the case of plants, this grouping is called taxonomy. Traditionally, plants were sorted into groups based on what they looked like and how they were different from each other.\nNonetheless, for a long time, scientists have looked at specific traits to understand what makes something a plant. These traits have taught us a couple of important things about plants:\n\nPlants are organisms that use a process called photosynthesis to make their own food. This sets them apart from many other living things.\nThey have a special way of life that involves different stages in their cycle. Sometimes they have a part that’s like a “baby” version (called gametophyte) and another part that’s more grown-up (called sporophyte). This alternation between these two stages is a big part of what makes plants unique.\n\nAs scientists have discovered more about different living things, they’ve had to rethink how they define plants. Organisms that were once thought to belong only to the “Plant Kingdom” have been moved to their own groups, like Fungi. This is because we now know more about their characteristics.\nThe way scientists sort living things has also changed over time. It started with a simple “Two Kingdom” idea, where there were just Plants and Animals. Then it grew to a “Five Kingdom” idea, adding Fungi, Protists, and Bacteria. Now, things have evolved even more into the concept of “Three Domains”: Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria. But what’s really important is that the way scientists classify living things has shifted. Instead of just looking at how things appear, they now focus a lot on the relationships between organisms and how they’ve evolved. This new way of sorting is all about understanding the family tree of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogeny of Plants\n\n\n\n\nDefining plants can be a bit tricky. Some people think of plants as organisms that can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. They also have a special kind of life cycle called “alternation of generations.” However, not every organism with these features belongs to the same group on the tree of life as plants do.\nIn this course, the focus is narrowed down. They will be looking specifically at “green plants.” And to be even more precise, they’ll be studying “Land Plants,” which are also known as “Embryophytes.” These are the plants that live on land and have certain characteristics that set them apart.\n\n1.1.1 Phylogeny versus Classification\nPhylogeny is about showing how different living things are related to each other. It’s like drawing a family tree that connects all the creatures. These family trees not only tell us about relationships but also give clues about the history and environment of different groups of organisms. Plus, they show how organisms have changed over time to fit their surroundings better.\nClassification, on the other hand, is more about giving names and organizing the incredible variety of life. It’s like putting different things into different boxes based on how they look or behave.\nNow, when it comes to plants, their phylogeny helps experts decide how to classify them. By understanding the connections between different plant groups, scientists can figure out the best way to group and name them. It’s like solving a puzzle where the pieces are the relationships between plants.\nIf a plant flowers, it’s called a angiosperm. Otherwise, it’s a gymnosperm."

Moving towards the right, there are filamentous organisms, which are like chains of cells. And on the far right, there’s something called “coenocytic.” This means it’s a big organism with many nuclei, or control centers, inside it. Unlike most organisms that have individual cells, this one doesn’t have clear divisions between its cells inside.\n\n\n1.2.2 Locophytes\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of a Locophyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Gingko Tree\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Gingko Tree’s Seeds\n\n\n\n\nTalking about the Ginkgo, there’s just one type that exists now, called Ginkgo biloba.

Instead, it creates something called spores. These spores are not the same as gametes.\nThese spores grow into a plant that can make gametes. This plant generation is called the gametophyte.\nWhen gametes from different plants come together, they make a cell with two sets again (2N). This cell, called a zygote, then grows into a different kind of plant, the sporophyte, which produces spores.\nSo, in plants, the cycle goes from spores to gametophyte to zygote to Sporophyte and back again. It’s a bit different from what happens in animals."

However, they are responsible for performing metabolism within the plant.\nCollenchyma\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Lignin\n\n\n\n\nThese cells are found in primary tissue, but their cell walls are made of a kind of sugar called cellulose (i.e., not lignin). Cells with a lignified xylem (e.g., fiber and sclerenchyma cells) are usually associated with secondary (and some primary) tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bundle of Celery\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, celery leaves are held up by the celery itself which is made out of collenchyma cells.\n\n\n2.2.1 Silver Cells\nThese are cells that basically move photosynthate (e.g., sugars and whatnot) and are made up of two things: sieve cells and companion cells.\n\n\n2.2.2 Conducting and Vascular Tissue\nThese tissues serve to move water (i.e., the xylem) and other items (i.e., the phloem) around the plant, and each tissue type serves multiple functions.\n\n2.2.2.1 Xylem\nThis tissue is actually made up of many different cells and are entirely made out of dead cells when in its later stages (i.e., when the xylem reaches “maturity”).\nThe xylem also forms one continuous column from the plant’s roots to its leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Cells in the Xylem\n\n\n\n\nThe cells that move water throughout the xylem (i.e., the conducting cells) have two kinds:\n\nTracheids\nThese are narrow cells with tapered ends. All plants that have vascular systems have this.\nVessels\nThese are found in most, but not all flowering plants. These kinds of cells have a larger diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Helianthus Stem\n\n\n\n\nWhen the xylem thickens, it’s mainly because of the secondary xylem (i.e., wood). It grows because of thet vascular cambium.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Other Tissue and Cell Types\nProf. Lum lists some more:\n\nThe bark - this is also called the periderm.\nSclerenchyma - these are made out of something called linear fibers.\nLenticels - these cells exchange air in shoot and root surfaces.\nTrichomes - these are hair-like projections that grow out of the epidermis."

Instead, they show vessel-like elements.\n\n2.3.1 Vascular Tissue in Monocots versus Dicots\nDicotyledonous plants (i.e., dicots) are plants whose seeds have embryos with two things called cotyledons or seedling leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Monocot Stem\n\n\n\n\nMonocotyledonous plants (i.e., monocots), on the contrary, are plants whose seeds have embryos that only have one cotyledon.\nDicot stems have a ring-like formation because of how their vascular tissue are arranged, whereas monocot stems are more scattered.\n\n\n2.3.2 Leaves\nThese plant organs have a stomata and an epidermis, layers, a vascular system (i.e., phloem and xylem), and may even have special layers to them. There’s also a ton of variation among leaves in terms of their shape and function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStoma and Guard Cell of a Tomato Plant’s Leaves\n\n\n\n\nThe epidermis is just the outer layer of plant tissues (i.e., kinda like the outer layer of skin on humans). The stoma - on the other hand - are just the pores in the epidermis of tissues that conduct photosynthesis. The stoma has two cells: a pair of guard cells that are surrounded by subsidiary cells.\n\n2.3.2.1 Venation and Stomata Distribution\nThe organization of vascular tissue and the distribution of stomata differs between monocots and dicots in the following ways:\n\nLeaves in dicot plants have veins that are net-like. Leaves in monocot leaves have veisn that are in parallel structures.\nDifferent stomata distribution patterns reflect the fact that venation is different in monocots and dicots.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Roots versus Shoots\nRoots and shoots differ in terms of how their vascular tissues are arranged. In root tissue, the vascular tissue have protective layers - like an endodermis and a root cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Buttercup’s Root\n\n\n\n\nHowever, root and shoot tissue have something called a zone of maturation. The xylem and the phloem alternate in root tissue (as seen above).\n\n2.3.3.1 Modified Roots\n\n\n\n\n\nModified Roots in a Freshwater Swamp Forest\n\n\n\n\nThese are roots that have been modified to serve a specific purpose other than just anchoring the plant to the ground. The above tree from a swamp is an example."

The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving…”\n– Charles Darwin\n\nIt was through these ideas that he founded the idea of natural selection - in a nutshell, these are:\n\nIndividuals vary\nSome of these variations in 1. are rooted in genetics.\nThere’s a tendency for the population of a species to grow exponentially.\nThese variations in 1. may affect the ability of individuals to survive - this is called their fitness: their ability to survive and reproduce.\nIndividuals that have favorable variations are live and reproduce - we say that these individuals are naturally selected.\n\nFor the man himself, Ecology was the meat of his natural selection idea. If there was nothing that to make surviving difficult, then there would be no reason for individuals to have different fitnesses and therefore, also nothing to make natural selection happen."

This absorbed energy is then relayed to where photosynthesis actually occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nTwo pigments - chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b - are used to capture light in photosynthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Harvesting Complexes in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nAt least in the memrbane protein LHCII, the said pigments are arranged into a sort of antennae. Scientists think that each 25 kDa protein above binds 14 chlorophylls and also four things called xanthophylls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessory Light-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, pigments called accessory pigments can help pick up light that are otherwise not absorbed by chlorophyll. Because of this, photosynthesis is able to become more efficient as these pigments can also transmit the energy to where photosynthesis happens.\nThe cool thing about these pigments too is that they help protect organisms against intense or damaging sunlight.\n\n4.2.1.1 Absorbing Light\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Light Absorption Works\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is absorbed, this causes a molecule to become “excited” and go to a higher energy state.\nThe difference between this “excited” and normal state is referred to as \\(\\Delta E\\) - the difference can be calculated using:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light absorbed.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Energy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\nWhen an electron is excited inside the chlorophyll, the following actions can happen:\n\nFluorescence\nHere, an excited electron releases a photon and returns to its original state.\nReturning to the Ground State\nWhen this happens, energy that the electron has is lost as heat to the environment.\nEnergy Transfer\nThe energy that was lost as heat is then taken up by another electron\nPhotochemistry\nThis loss in energy causes chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Where is Light Absorbed?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations of Light Absorption\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is captured, it is captured on the antennae before this light energy is sent to the reaction centers.\nProf. Oliver also lists a few terminology:\n\nPhotosystem\nThis is a structure that is made out of a reaction center (i.e., RC) and an antenna or light harvesting complex.\nReaction Center (i.e., RC)\nThese help convert light energy turn into chemical energy. These are also just protein bits (i.e., subunits) that have things called cofactors attached to them that are found in the middle of the photosystem.\nAntenna or light harvesting complexes\nThese structures have chlorophyll and other accessory pigments; they surround the RC and help absorb light and sent it to the RC.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Charge Separation\nOnce pigments absorb energy, this energy needs to be sent over in a way called resonance energy transfer. What this basically means is that after the light energy goes from the antennae to the reaction center, an electron is transferred over to the membrane and to a donor, and this causes something called photoinduced charge separation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge Separation in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason this is possible is because electron transfer is a lot faster (i.e, 3 ps).\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Kinds of Photosystems in Oxygenic Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThat said, there are also two kinds of photosystems in oxygenic photosystems. These two kinds of photosystems are related to the way that prokaryotes perform anoxygenic photosynthesis.\n\n\n4.2.3 Electron Transfer\nThis step moves electrons across a chain to do two things: to make a proton motive force and to also make NADPH.\nAll electron transfer reactions involve something called oxidation reduction reactions. In the case of the equation for photosynthesis:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  6CO_2 + 12H_2O \\stackrel{\\text{light}}{\\longrightarrow} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe reducer (i.e., reducing species) is the water molecule H2O and one to become oxidized is the carbon dioxide (i.e., the CO2).\nWe use the symbol \\(\\Delta G\\) to illustrate the tendency of redox reactions to proceed. This symbol is also called the free energy.\n\n4.2.3.1 Free Energy and Redox Potentials\nThe value of \\(\\Delta G\\) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta G = -nF\\Delta E^\\theta\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe higher the potential that something has, this means that it is a great reducing agent. This also means that this something also has a greater tendency to accept electrons (and vice versa).\nHence, electrons will willing flow from substances with low tendencies to accept electrons to substances with high tendencies for electrons."

The cycle does three things:\n\nCombine carbon dioxide (i.e., CO2) with a sugar called ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (i.e., RuBP) to form two three-carbon intermediary products: 3-phosphoglycerate (i.e., 3PGA).\nReduce 3PGA to form something called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (i.e., G3P).\nRemake RuBP.\n\nIn short, we can summarize the Calvin cycle using this chemical equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  &3CO_2 + 5H_2O + 6 NADPH + 9 ATP \\stackrel{\\text{Rubisco and other enzymes}}{\\longrightarrow} \\\\\n  &G3P + 3H^+ + 6NADP^+ + 9 ADP + 8P_i\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n5.1.1 What is Rubisco?\nThis is an enzyme that many scientists want to know more about.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco’s Action\n\n\n\n\nThe enzyme rubisco - short for “Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase” - is responsible for turning one molecule of RuBP into two molecules of 3PGA.\nWhat’s interesting is that rubisco is the most common protein on Earth, but this enzyme often takes the most time to do its job in the dark portion of photosynthesis. Though, what’s also interesting is that there are more efficient enzymes than the Rubisco that crops have.\n\n\n5.1.2 Stages of Calvin Cycle\nThis cycle has three main stages:\n\nReduction\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction Portion of Calvin Cycle\n\n\n\n\nIn this portino of the cycle, there’s an enzyme called 3PGA Kinase. It basically phosphorylates (i.e., adds a phosphate group) 3PGA to turn it into 1,3-PG.\nThen, another enzyme called NADP-G3P dehydrogenase reduces that 1,3-GP into the G3P that was mentioned earlier.\nCarboxylation and Reduction\n\n\n\n\n\nCarboxylation and Reduction Portion of the Calvin Cycle\n\n\n\n\nWhen we add carbons to three RuBP molecules, this gives us six G3P molecules.

    "section": "5.2 Rubisco",
    "text": "5.2 Rubisco\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nRubisco is like a big protein (i.e., around 550 kDa) with eight large parts (i.e., LSU) and eight small parts (i.e., SSU), making a total of 16 parts. These LSU parts form pairs called dimers, and each dimer has two special spots for chemical reactions (i.e., the stars). These spots are made up of different parts of the LSU. All Rubiscos have these same spots.\nThese dimers group together to form an eight-part core (i.e., L8). Around this core, there are eight small subunits (SSUs), split into two groups – one at the top and one at the bottom of the core. The core’s full activity depends on these SSU parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco as a Bifunctional Enzyme\n\n\n\n\nApart from its main job of adding CO2 to RuBP, Rubisco can also do something else. It can work with O2 and attach it to RuBP. However, this oxygen part is like a competitor to the carbon dioxide. They look alike and behave in a similar way, so sometimes oxygen gets in the way of CO2 doing its job.\n\n5.2.1 Activation with CO2 and Mg2+\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a special spot in all Rubisco large subunits called Lys 201, which plays a crucial role. It helps CO2 slowly stick to it, forming something called a carbamate (EC). This CO2 that sticks here is like an “activator” and is different from the CO2 used for the main job of fixing carbon with RuBP.\nTo make sure this carbamate is stable, it needs the help of magnesium ions (Mg2+). When these ions quickly attach to the active site, it makes the spot ready for the actual chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n5.2.2 Photorespiration\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotorespiration by Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nWhen Rubisco uses oxygen instead of carbon dioxide to work with RuBP, it’s not very efficient. This is considered wasteful because it requires a lot of energy and resources to fix the mistakes that happen during this process. It takes up energy (ATP) and some other important stuff, and it even loses some of the carbon dioxide that was supposed to be captured.\nThis problem with Rubisco’s preference for oxygen over carbon dioxide (called CO2 / O2 specificity) affects how efficiently plants can use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. It determines whether carbon gets used for making sugars in the Calvin cycle (good) or gets lost in a less useful process called photorespiration (not so good).\n\n\n5.2.3 Catalysis\nRubisco manages five different steps during catalysis, and each of these steps is complex enough that it would typically need its own enzyme to get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalysis by Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nHowever, alongside its main job, Rubisco sometimes gets sidetracked into unproductive side reactions, shown in blue. These side reactions aren’t helpful; they can either create compounds that inhibit Rubisco’s own function (like XuBP) or decrease the amount of a useful product called 3-PGA that should be produced. These side distractions reduce the overall efficiency of Rubisco’s work.\n\n\n5.2.4 Rubisco is Inefficient\nRubisco isn’t good at capturing carbon dioxide. There are a few reasons for this:\n\nAbortive Side Reactions\nRubisco sometimes gets distracted by unproductive side reactions.\nLow Specificity for CO2\nIt isn’t very picky and often mistakes oxygen for carbon dioxide.\nSlow Working Speed\nRubisco works quite slowly, with a turnover rate of about one to two reactions per second in real-life conditions.\n\nBecause of these limitations, plants have to invest a lot of their resources into Rubisco to make sure they can capture enough carbon dioxide to grow effectively.\n\n5.2.4.1 Overcoming Rubisco’s Inefficiency\nRubisco plays a significant role in how much water a leaf needs to let evaporate to get carbon dioxide. This is called the transpiration ratio. In tobacco, for instance, this ratio is usually around 500 to 1000, but it can change depending on factors like light, temperature, and humidity.\nThe efficiency of Rubisco directly affects this transpiration ratio, especially when there isn’t much carbon dioxide around. If Rubisco works better (meaning it can work faster and is better at picking carbon dioxide over oxygen), it allows the leaf to do its job with less carbon dioxide. As a result, the leaf can close its stomatal pores a bit to reduce water loss while still getting enough carbon dioxide for photosynthesis."

This protein’s job is to clean up any mess left behind by inhibitory sugar-phosphate molecules. These inhibitory molecules can come from natural processes or the side reactions we talked about earlier.\nRubisco activase works by interacting with Rubisco’s big structures and using energy from ATP to get rid of these sugar-phosphate molecules that are stuck to Rubisco’s active sites - E, EC, or ECM. This cleaning process allows Rubisco to get back to work, so it can do its job of capturing carbon dioxide and helping with photosynthesis.\n\n5.3.1 Structure of Rubisco Activase\nRubisco activase is a protein that’s relatively small, measuring about 42 to 46 kDa. In some plants, there are two slightly different versions of this protein due to alternative splicing of the same genetic instructions. These variations mainly differ in the length of their tail-end.\nFor Rubisco activase to do its job properly, six of these protein molecules need to come together and form a circular hexamer complex. This arrangement was only figured out in 2011, after 20 years of research.\nInterestingly, the 46 kDa version of Rubisco activase has some cysteine residues in its tail-end. These cysteine parts are important because they allow its activity to be regulated by a system involving ferredoxin and thioredoxin."

    "text": "5.4 Regulating the Calvin Cycle\n\n\n\n\n\nCalvin Cycle Regulation Mechanisms\n\n\n\n\nThe Calvin cycle involves several enzymes like FBPase, SBPase, PRK, 1,3-PG dehydrogenase, and sometimes Rubisco activase. These enzymes don’t work at full speed all the time; their activity is actually controlled by light.\nThis control happens through something called the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. It’s like a link that connects the light absorbed by the thylakoid membranes to the performance of these enzymes in the stroma, the fluid inside the chloroplasts. So, when there’s light, these enzymes can work better, which is important for photosynthesis.\nWhen light is present, what happens is that there’s more magnesium and less H+ ions, and this helps activate FBPase, SBPase, PRK, and Rubisco.\n\n5.4.1 Why Regulate the Calvin Cycle?\nRunning the Calvin cycle just right is super important. It needs to go at a pace that matches the current conditions, like how much sunlight there is. Also, the amounts of different substances within the cycle need to stay balanced. If the cycle goes too fast or slow at different points, it can mess things up by storing too much of some substances and causing problems.\nGetting out of the cycle also has to be carefully managed. If not enough triose phosphates are taken out, it causes a buildup of certain sugars, and there won’t be enough phosphate for making ATP. On the other hand, if too much is removed, we can’t use the energy and reducing power produced during the light reactions effectively. So, it’s crucial to strike the right balance."

This forms another 4-carbon acid, like malate or aspartate.\nTransport to Bundle Sheath Cells\nThese 4-carbon acids are then moved to the bundle sheath cells.\nDecarboxylation\nIn the bundle sheath cells, these 4-carbon acids are transformed to release CO2 and a 3-carbon acid.\nCO2 Fixation\nThis released CO2 is captured by Rubisco in the bundle sheath cells through the Calvin cycle.\nTransport Back to Mesophyll Cells\nThe 3-carbon acid product goes back to the mesophyll cells to make more PEP, and the cycle continues.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Favorable Characteristics in C4 Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco Content in C3 and C4 Plants\n\n\n\n\nC4 plants have a clever way of concentrating carbon dioxide near Rubisco, the enzyme that helps with photosynthesis. This has some important benefits. It reduces the chance of Rubisco mistakenly using oxygen, which is a good thing because it lowers the rate of photorespiration.\nAdditionally, these plants don’t need as much Rubisco, which is a protein, because they have higher Vcmax rates. This makes them better at using nitrogen efficiently. Also, they use bicarbonate (HCO3-) as their main source of carbon, and this doesn’t lead to oxygenation like CO2 can. Because of this, C4 plants can operate with lower levels of CO2 inside their cells. This means they can have smaller stomata openings, which helps them use water more efficiently compared to C3 plants.\n\n\n5.5.3 CAM Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nCAM Photosynthesis Overview\n\n\n\n\nCAM photosynthesis is a kind of photosynthesis that happens and is regulated by phosphorylation instead of light.\nCAM photosynthesis is used by plants that live in dry places like succulents (such as cacti) and some tropical plants like orchids. The way they capture carbon dioxide is quite similar to C4 plants. However, CAM plants do something interesting. Instead of separating the two steps of capturing CO2 in different parts of the plant, they do it at different times of the day.\nOne notable thing about CAM plants is how they control the opening and closing of their stomata, the tiny pores on their leaves. Unlike most plants that open stomata during the day and close them at night, CAM plants do the opposite. They open their stomata at night and close them during the day. This helps them save water, which is crucial in dry environments.\nHowever, there’s a trade-off. Because CAM plants can’t store as much of the substances they make as other plants, they don’t grow as much biomass each day."
