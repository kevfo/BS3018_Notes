Second, they’re useful for studying development and other processes. Third, by looking at plants, one can understand things from genes to whole communities. Lastly, plants matter a lot.\nIn this lecture, there are some important words to remember:\nPlants are incredibly important because life wouldn’t be possible without them. They provide us with essential things we need to survive. Imagine staple foods like rice, wheat, corn, and potatoes – these come from plants and make up a big part of our diets. Even things like fruits, herbs, and spices, like chili, coffee, and chocolate, all come from different types of plants. Each of these plants contributes to the foods we eat and enjoy.\nNowadays, people are getting more worried about having enough food for everyone. That’s why understanding plant biology is super important now. It helps us make sure there’s enough food for everyone.\nIn this week’s session, we’re going to learn about a few things:"

    "section": "1.1 What is a Plant?",
    "text": "1.1 What is a Plant?\nWhen we look at living things, it’s normal to put them into groups based on the things they have in common. People have always done this. In the case of plants, this grouping is called taxonomy. Traditionally, plants were sorted into groups based on what they looked like and how they were different from each other.\nNonetheless, for a long time, scientists have looked at specific traits to understand what makes something a plant. These traits have taught us a couple of important things about plants:\n\nPlants are organisms that use a process called photosynthesis to make their own food. This sets them apart from many other living things.\nThey have a special way of life that involves different stages in their cycle. Sometimes they have a part that’s like a “baby” version (called gametophyte) and another part that’s more grown-up (called sporophyte). This alternation between these two stages is a big part of what makes plants unique.\n\nAs scientists have discovered more about different living things, they’ve had to rethink how they define plants. Organisms that were once thought to belong only to the “Plant Kingdom” have been moved to their own groups, like Fungi. This is because we now know more about their characteristics.\nThe way scientists sort living things has also changed over time. It started with a simple “Two Kingdom” idea, where there were just Plants and Animals. Then it grew to a “Five Kingdom” idea, adding Fungi, Protists, and Bacteria. Now, things have evolved even more into the concept of “Three Domains”: Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria. But what’s really important is that the way scientists classify living things has shifted. Instead of just looking at how things appear, they now focus a lot on the relationships between organisms and how they’ve evolved. This new way of sorting is all about understanding the family tree of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogeny of Plants\n\n\n\n\nDefining plants can be a bit tricky. Some people think of plants as organisms that can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. They also have a special kind of life cycle called “alternation of generations.” However, not every organism with these features belongs to the same group on the tree of life as plants do.\nIn this course, the focus is narrowed down. They will be looking specifically at “green plants.” And to be even more precise, they’ll be studying “Land Plants,” which are also known as “Embryophytes.” These are the plants that live on land and have certain characteristics that set them apart.\n\n1.1.1 Phylogeny versus Classification\nPhylogeny is about showing how different living things are related to each other. It’s like drawing a family tree that connects all the creatures. These family trees not only tell us about relationships but also give clues about the history and environment of different groups of organisms. Plus, they show how organisms have changed over time to fit their surroundings better.\nClassification, on the other hand, is more about giving names and organizing the incredible variety of life. It’s like putting different things into different boxes based on how they look or behave.\nNow, when it comes to plants, their phylogeny helps experts decide how to classify them. By understanding the connections between different plant groups, scientists can figure out the best way to group and name them. It’s like solving a puzzle where the pieces are the relationships between plants.\nIf a plant flowers, it’s called a angiosperm. Otherwise, it’s a gymnosperm."

Moving towards the right, there are filamentous organisms, which are like chains of cells. And on the far right, there’s something called “coenocytic.” This means it’s a big organism with many nuclei, or control centers, inside it. Unlike most organisms that have individual cells, this one doesn’t have clear divisions between its cells inside.\n\n\n1.2.2 Locophytes\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of a Locophyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Gingko Tree\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Gingko Tree’s Seeds\n\n\n\n\nTalking about the Ginkgo, there’s just one type that exists now, called Ginkgo biloba.

Instead, it creates something called spores. These spores are not the same as gametes.\nThese spores grow into a plant that can make gametes. This plant generation is called the gametophyte.\nWhen gametes from different plants come together, they make a cell with two sets again (2N). This cell, called a zygote, then grows into a different kind of plant, the sporophyte, which produces spores.\nSo, in plants, the cycle goes from spores to gametophyte to zygote to Sporophyte and back again. It’s a bit different from what happens in animals."

However, they are responsible for performing metabolism within the plant.\nCollenchyma\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Lignin\n\n\n\n\nThese cells are found in primary tissue, but their cell walls are made of a kind of sugar called cellulose (i.e., not lignin). Cells with a lignified xylem (e.g., fiber and sclerenchyma cells) are usually associated with secondary (and some primary) tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bundle of Celery\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, celery leaves are held up by the celery itself which is made out of collenchyma cells.\n\n\n2.2.1 Silver Cells\nThese are cells that basically move photosynthate (e.g., sugars and whatnot) and are made up of two things: sieve cells and companion cells.\n\n\n2.2.2 Conducting and Vascular Tissue\nThese tissues serve to move water (i.e., the xylem) and other items (i.e., the phloem) around the plant, and each tissue type serves multiple functions.\n\n2.2.2.1 Xylem\nThis tissue is actually made up of many different cells and are entirely made out of dead cells when in its later stages (i.e., when the xylem reaches “maturity”).\nThe xylem also forms one continuous column from the plant’s roots to its leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Cells in the Xylem\n\n\n\n\nThe cells that move water throughout the xylem (i.e., the conducting cells) have two kinds:\n\nTracheids\nThese are narrow cells with tapered ends. All plants that have vascular systems have this.\nVessels\nThese are found in most, but not all flowering plants. These kinds of cells have a larger diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Helianthus Stem\n\n\n\n\nWhen the xylem thickens, it’s mainly because of the secondary xylem (i.e., wood). It grows because of thet vascular cambium.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Other Tissue and Cell Types\nProf. Lum lists some more:\n\nThe bark - this is also called the periderm.\nSclerenchyma - these are made out of something called linear fibers.\nLenticels - these cells exchange air in shoot and root surfaces.\nTrichomes - these are hair-like projections that grow out of the epidermis."

Instead, they show vessel-like elements.\n\n2.3.1 Vascular Tissue in Monocots versus Dicots\nDicotyledonous plants (i.e., dicots) are plants whose seeds have embryos with two things called cotyledons or seedling leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Monocot Stem\n\n\n\n\nMonocotyledonous plants (i.e., monocots), on the contrary, are plants whose seeds have embryos that only have one cotyledon.\nDicot stems have a ring-like formation because of how their vascular tissue are arranged, whereas monocot stems are more scattered.\n\n\n2.3.2 Leaves\nThese plant organs have a stomata and an epidermis, layers, a vascular system (i.e., phloem and xylem), and may even have special layers to them. There’s also a ton of variation among leaves in terms of their shape and function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStoma and Guard Cell of a Tomato Plant’s Leaves\n\n\n\n\nThe epidermis is just the outer layer of plant tissues (i.e., kinda like the outer layer of skin on humans). The stoma - on the other hand - are just the pores in the epidermis of tissues that conduct photosynthesis. The stoma has two cells: a pair of guard cells that are surrounded by subsidiary cells.\n\n2.3.2.1 Venation and Stomata Distribution\nThe organization of vascular tissue and the distribution of stomata differs between monocots and dicots in the following ways:\n\nLeaves in dicot plants have veins that are net-like. Leaves in monocot leaves have veisn that are in parallel structures.\nDifferent stomata distribution patterns reflect the fact that venation is different in monocots and dicots.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Roots versus Shoots\nRoots and shoots differ in terms of how their vascular tissues are arranged. In root tissue, the vascular tissue have protective layers - like an endodermis and a root cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Buttercup’s Root\n\n\n\n\nHowever, root and shoot tissue have something called a zone of maturation. The xylem and the phloem alternate in root tissue (as seen above).\n\n2.3.3.1 Modified Roots\n\n\n\n\n\nModified Roots in a Freshwater Swamp Forest\n\n\n\n\nThese are roots that have been modified to serve a specific purpose other than just anchoring the plant to the ground. The above tree from a swamp is an example."

The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving…”\n– Charles Darwin\n\nIt was through these ideas that he founded the idea of natural selection - in a nutshell, these are:\n\nIndividuals vary\nSome of these variations in 1. are rooted in genetics.\nThere’s a tendency for the population of a species to grow exponentially.\nThese variations in 1. may affect the ability of individuals to survive - this is called their fitness: their ability to survive and reproduce.\nIndividuals that have favorable variations are live and reproduce - we say that these individuals are naturally selected.\n\nFor the man himself, Ecology was the meat of his natural selection idea. If there was nothing that to make surviving difficult, then there would be no reason for individuals to have different fitnesses and therefore, also nothing to make natural selection happen."

This absorbed energy is then relayed to where photosynthesis actually occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nTwo pigments - chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b - are used to capture light in photosynthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Harvesting Complexes in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nAt least in the memrbane protein LHCII, the said pigments are arranged into a sort of antennae. Scientists think that each 25 kDa protein above binds 14 chlorophylls and also four things called xanthophylls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessory Light-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, pigments called accessory pigments can help pick up light that are otherwise not absorbed by chlorophyll. Because of this, photosynthesis is able to become more efficient as these pigments can also transmit the energy to where photosynthesis happens.\nThe cool thing about these pigments too is that they help protect organisms against intense or damaging sunlight.\n\n4.2.1.1 Absorbing Light\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Light Absorption Works\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is absorbed, this causes a molecule to become “excited” and go to a higher energy state.\nThe difference between this “excited” and normal state is referred to as \\(\\Delta E\\) - the difference can be calculated using:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light absorbed.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Energy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\nWhen an electron is excited inside the chlorophyll, the following actions can happen:\n\nFluorescence\nHere, an excited electron releases a photon and returns to its original state.\nReturning to the Ground State\nWhen this happens, energy that the electron has is lost as heat to the environment.\nEnergy Transfer\nThe energy that was lost as heat is then taken up by another electron\nPhotochemistry\nThis loss in energy causes chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Where is Light Absorbed?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations of Light Absorption\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is captured, it is captured on the antennae before this light energy is sent to the reaction centers.\nProf. Oliver also lists a few terminology:\n\nPhotosystem\nThis is a structure that is made out of a reaction center (i.e., RC) and an antenna or light harvesting complex.\nReaction Center (i.e., RC)\nThese help convert light energy turn into chemical energy. These are also just protein bits (i.e., subunits) that have things called cofactors attached to them that are found in the middle of the photosystem.\nAntenna or light harvesting complexes\nThese structures have chlorophyll and other accessory pigments; they surround the RC and help absorb light and sent it to the RC.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Charge Separation\nOnce pigments absorb energy, this energy needs to be sent over in a way called resonance energy transfer. What this basically means is that after the light energy goes from the antennae to the reaction center, an electron is transferred over to the membrane and to a donor, and this causes something called photoinduced charge separation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge Separation in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason this is possible is because electron transfer is a lot faster (i.e, 3 ps).\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Kinds of Photosystems in Oxygenic Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThat said, there are also two kinds of photosystems in oxygenic photosystems. These two kinds of photosystems are related to the way that prokaryotes perform anoxygenic photosynthesis.\n\n\n4.2.3 Electron Transfer\nThis step moves electrons across a chain to do two things: to make a proton motive force and to also make NADPH.\nAll electron transfer reactions involve something called oxidation reduction reactions. In the case of the equation for photosynthesis:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  6CO_2 + 12H_2O \\stackrel{\\text{light}}{\\longrightarrow} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe reducer (i.e., reducing species) is the water molecule H2O and one to become oxidized is the carbon dioxide (i.e., the CO2).\nWe use the symbol \\(\\Delta G\\) to illustrate the tendency of redox reactions to proceed. This symbol is also called the free energy.\n\n4.2.3.1 Free Energy and Redox Potentials\nThe value of \\(\\Delta G\\) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta G = -nF\\Delta E^\\theta\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe higher the potential that something has, this means that it is a great reducing agent. This also means that this something also has a greater tendency to accept electrons (and vice versa).\nHence, electrons will willing flow from substances with low tendencies to accept electrons to substances with high tendencies for electrons."

The cycle does three things:\n\nCombine carbon dioxide (i.e., CO2) with a sugar called ribulose-1,5-biphosphate (i.e., RuBP) to form two three-carbon intermediary products: 3-phosphoglycerate (i.e., 3PGA).\nReduce 3PGA to form something called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (i.e., G3P).\nRemake RuBP.\n\nIn short, we can summarize the Calvin cycle using this chemical equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n  &3CO_2 + 5H_2O + 6 NADPH + 9 ATP \\stackrel{\\text{Rubisco and other enzymes}}{\\longrightarrow} \\\\\n  &G3P + 3H^+ + 6NADP^+ + 9 ADP + 8P_i\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n5.1.1 What is Rubisco?\nThis is an enzyme that many scientists want to know more about.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco’s Action\n\n\n\n\nThe enzyme rubisco - short for “Ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase / oxygenase” - is responsible for turning one molecule of RuBP into two molecules of 3PGA.\nWhat’s interesting is that rubisco is the most common protein on Earth, but this enzyme often takes the most time to do its job in the dark portion of photosynthesis. Though, what’s also interesting is that there are more efficient enzymes than the Rubisco that crops have.\n\n\n5.1.2 Stages of Calvin Cycle\nThis cycle has three main stages:\n\nReduction\n\n\n\n\n\nReduction Portion of Calvin Cycle\n\n\n\n\nIn this portino of the cycle, there’s an enzyme called 3PGA Kinase.

    "section": "5.2 Rubisco",
    "text": "5.2 Rubisco\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nRubisco is like a big protein (i.e., around 550 kDa) with eight large parts (i.e., LSU) and eight small parts (i.e., SSU), making a total of 16 parts. These LSU parts form pairs called dimers, and each dimer has two special spots for chemical reactions (i.e., the stars). These spots are made up of different parts of the LSU. All Rubiscos have these same spots.\nThese dimers group together to form an eight-part core (i.e., L8). Around this core, there are eight small subunits (SSUs), split into two groups – one at the top and one at the bottom of the core. The core’s full activity depends on these SSU parts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco as a Bifunctional Enzyme\n\n\n\n\nApart from its main job of adding CO2 to RuBP, Rubisco can also do something else. It can work with O2 and attach it to RuBP. However, this oxygen part is like a competitor to the carbon dioxide. They look alike and behave in a similar way, so sometimes oxygen gets in the way of CO2 doing its job.\n\n5.2.1 Activation with CO2 and Mg2+\n\n\n\n\n\nActivating Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a special spot in all Rubisco large subunits called Lys 201, which plays a crucial role. It helps CO2 slowly stick to it, forming something called a carbamate (EC). This CO2 that sticks here is like an “activator” and is different from the CO2 used for the main job of fixing carbon with RuBP.\nTo make sure this carbamate is stable, it needs the help of magnesium ions (Mg2+). When these ions quickly attach to the active site, it makes the spot ready for the actual chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n5.2.2 Photorespiration\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotorespiration by Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nWhen Rubisco uses oxygen instead of carbon dioxide to work with RuBP, it’s not very efficient. This is considered wasteful because it requires a lot of energy and resources to fix the mistakes that happen during this process. It takes up energy (ATP) and some other important stuff, and it even loses some of the carbon dioxide that was supposed to be captured.\nThis problem with Rubisco’s preference for oxygen over carbon dioxide (called CO2 / O2 specificity) affects how efficiently plants can use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. It determines whether carbon gets used for making sugars in the Calvin cycle (good) or gets lost in a less useful process called photorespiration (not so good).\n\n\n5.2.3 Catalysis\nRubisco manages five different steps during catalysis, and each of these steps is complex enough that it would typically need its own enzyme to get the job done.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatalysis by Rubisco\n\n\n\n\nHowever, alongside its main job, Rubisco sometimes gets sidetracked into unproductive side reactions, shown in blue. These side reactions aren’t helpful; they can either create compounds that inhibit Rubisco’s own function (like XuBP) or decrease the amount of a useful product called 3-PGA that should be produced. These side distractions reduce the overall efficiency of Rubisco’s work.\n\n\n5.2.4 Rubisco is Inefficient\nRubisco isn’t good at capturing carbon dioxide. There are a few reasons for this:\n\nAbortive Side Reactions\nRubisco sometimes gets distracted by unproductive side reactions.\nLow Specificity for CO2\nIt isn’t very picky and often mistakes oxygen for carbon dioxide.\nSlow Working Speed\nRubisco works quite slowly, with a turnover rate of about one to two reactions per second in real-life conditions.\n\nBecause of these limitations, plants have to invest a lot of their resources into Rubisco to make sure they can capture enough carbon dioxide to grow effectively.\n\n5.2.4.1 Overcoming Rubisco’s Inefficiency\nRubisco plays a significant role in how much water a leaf needs to let evaporate to get carbon dioxide. This is called the transpiration ratio. In tobacco, for instance, this ratio is usually around 500 to 1000, but it can change depending on factors like light, temperature, and humidity.\nThe efficiency of Rubisco directly affects this transpiration ratio, especially when there isn’t much carbon dioxide around. If Rubisco works better (meaning it can work faster and is better at picking carbon dioxide over oxygen), it allows the leaf to do its job with less carbon dioxide. As a result, the leaf can close its stomatal pores a bit to reduce water loss while still getting enough carbon dioxide for photosynthesis."

This protein’s job is to clean up any mess left behind by inhibitory sugar-phosphate molecules. These inhibitory molecules can come from natural processes or the side reactions we talked about earlier.\nRubisco activase works by interacting with Rubisco’s big structures and using energy from ATP to get rid of these sugar-phosphate molecules that are stuck to Rubisco’s active sites - E, EC, or ECM. This cleaning process allows Rubisco to get back to work, so it can do its job of capturing carbon dioxide and helping with photosynthesis.\n\n5.3.1 Structure of Rubisco Activase\nRubisco activase is a protein that’s relatively small, measuring about 42 to 46 kDa. In some plants, there are two slightly different versions of this protein due to alternative splicing of the same genetic instructions. These variations mainly differ in the length of their tail-end.\nFor Rubisco activase to do its job properly, six of these protein molecules need to come together and form a circular hexamer complex. This arrangement was only figured out in 2011, after 20 years of research.\nInterestingly, the 46 kDa version of Rubisco activase has some cysteine residues in its tail-end. These cysteine parts are important because they allow its activity to be regulated by a system involving ferredoxin and thioredoxin."

These enzymes don’t work at full speed all the time; their activity is actually controlled by light.\nThis control happens through something called the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system. It’s like a link that connects the light absorbed by the thylakoid membranes to the performance of these enzymes in the stroma, the fluid inside the chloroplasts. So, when there’s light, these enzymes can work better, which is important for photosynthesis.\nWhen light is present, what happens is that there’s more magnesium and less H+ ions, and this helps activate FBPase, SBPase, PRK, and Rubisco.\n\n5.4.1 Why Regulate the Calvin Cycle?\nRunning the Calvin cycle just right is super important. It needs to go at a pace that matches the current conditions, like how much sunlight there is. Also, the amounts of different substances within the cycle need to stay balanced. If the cycle goes too fast or slow at different points, it can mess things up by storing too much of some substances and causing problems.\nGetting out of the cycle also has to be carefully managed. If not enough triose phosphates are taken out, it causes a buildup of certain sugars, and there won’t be enough phosphate for making ATP. On the other hand, if too much is removed, we can’t use the energy and reducing power produced during the light reactions effectively. So, it’s crucial to strike the right balance."

This forms another 4-carbon acid, like malate or aspartate.\nTransport to Bundle Sheath Cells\nThese 4-carbon acids are then moved to the bundle sheath cells.\nDecarboxylation\nIn the bundle sheath cells, these 4-carbon acids are transformed to release CO2 and a 3-carbon acid.\nCO2 Fixation\nThis released CO2 is captured by Rubisco in the bundle sheath cells through the Calvin cycle.\nTransport Back to Mesophyll Cells\nThe 3-carbon acid product goes back to the mesophyll cells to make more PEP, and the cycle continues.\n\n\n\n5.5.2 Favorable Characteristics in C4 Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nRubisco Content in C3 and C4 Plants\n\n\n\n\nC4 plants have a clever way of concentrating carbon dioxide near Rubisco, the enzyme that helps with photosynthesis. This has some important benefits. It reduces the chance of Rubisco mistakenly using oxygen, which is a good thing because it lowers the rate of photorespiration.\nAdditionally, these plants don’t need as much Rubisco, which is a protein, because they have higher Vcmax rates. This makes them better at using nitrogen efficiently. Also, they use bicarbonate (HCO3-) as their main source of carbon, and this doesn’t lead to oxygenation like CO2 can. Because of this, C4 plants can operate with lower levels of CO2 inside their cells. This means they can have smaller stomata openings, which helps them use water more efficiently compared to C3 plants.\n\n\n5.5.3 CAM Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nCAM Photosynthesis Overview\n\n\n\n\nCAM photosynthesis is a kind of photosynthesis that happens and is regulated by phosphorylation instead of light.\nCAM photosynthesis is used by plants that live in dry places like succulents (such as cacti) and some tropical plants like orchids. The way they capture carbon dioxide is quite similar to C4 plants. However, CAM plants do something interesting. Instead of separating the two steps of capturing CO2 in different parts of the plant, they do it at different times of the day.\nOne notable thing about CAM plants is how they control the opening and closing of their stomata, the tiny pores on their leaves. Unlike most plants that open stomata during the day and close them at night, CAM plants do the opposite. They open their stomata at night and close them during the day. This helps them save water, which is crucial in dry environments.\nHowever, there’s a trade-off. Because CAM plants can’t store as much of the substances they make as other plants, they don’t grow as much biomass each day."

    "text": "Examples of Plant Hormones\nPlant hormones are like tiny messengers inside plants. They come in many different forms but are usually very small molecules. Even though they’re tiny, they have big jobs and work at really low levels. These hormones often travel from one part of the plant to another to deliver their messages. They’re like the plant’s way of sending signals.\nWhen these hormones reach their target, they make things happen. They can cause the plant to change how certain genes work. It’s kind of like flipping switches inside the plant to turn on or off different processes. These hormones do two main jobs:\nPlant hormone biology is really interesting to us humans for several reasons. One big reason is that the way plant hormones work, or sometimes don’t work, can have a big impact on agriculture. For example, there’s a hormone called ethylene that helps fruits ripen. Understanding how this hormone works can help us control when fruits ripen, which is essential for managing harvests.\nWe’ve also learned that we can use plant hormones to get the responses we want from plants. For instance, we can use hormones to make fruits ripen faster or delay the shedding of leaves. This kind of control is essential in agriculture.\nIn our efforts to breed plants for better qualities, we’ve noticed something interesting. Many of the plants we’ve bred for things like higher yields don’t produce or respond to hormones as effectively as wild plants. This is because what nature has selected for (survival in tough environments) isn’t always what we want (maximum production in controlled conditions). So, understanding how plant hormones work can help us create plants with the qualities we desire."

    "text": "6.1 Auxin\n\n\n\n\n\nDarwin and Sons’s Classic Experiments\n\n\n\n\nDarwin and his son made an interesting discovery about how plants respond to light. They found that the signal telling a plant to grow towards the light comes from the very tip of the shoot where it senses the light. But here’s the fascinating part – this signal doesn’t just stay at the tip. It travels down the shoot and affects what happens further down.\nThey also found that if you put something that water can’t pass through as a barrier, like a waterproof layer, it can stop this signal. But here’s an odd twist – if you use something like gelatin, which water can pass through, it doesn’t stop the signal.\n\n6.1.1 Polar Transport\n\n\n\n\n\nPolar Transport of Auxin\n\n\n\n\nAuxin is a special hormone in plants, and it moves around in a pretty interesting way. It doesn’t just float around randomly; it’s transported through special cells in the xylem called parenchyma cells. This method is faster than just spreading by diffusion, which is how things usually move in and out of cells.\nNow, here’s something unique about auxin: it always travels from the shoot (the upper part of the plant) to the root (the lower part), which is called basipetal transport. This one-way journey is possible thanks to specific proteins called PIN proteins. They act like precise carriers that ensure auxin goes in the right direction.\nWhen auxin enters a cell, it does so as an uncharged molecule called IAAH. But then, it gets trapped when it loses a proton and becomes IAA-. These charged forms of auxin are carried by a protein called AUX1.\nThe only way auxin can leave the cell is through other PIN carriers, but they’re located only on the basal side (the bottom part) of the cell. This setup makes auxin move in a specific direction, which is called polar transport. It’s worth noting that auxin is the only hormone that travels in this polar way in plants.\n\n\n6.1.2 What Does Auxin Do?\nAuxin, also known as IAA-, is like the conductor of a plant’s orchestra because it influences so many things.\nFirstly, it’s responsible for tropism, which is how plants move in response to their environment. For example, when a plant bends towards the light, it’s auxin that’s encouraging the cells to grow longer on one side, making the plant bend.\nIn terms of plant development, auxin plays a big role in something called apical dominance. This means it tells the plant not to grow branches from its main shoot until it’s ready. If you remove the main shoot, then the axillary buds can start growing. It also encourages more branching in the roots and helps fruits develop, especially when it’s produced in the seeds.\n\n\n6.1.3 Ubiquitin-Proteasome System\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkings of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System\n\n\n\n\nInside plant cells, there’s a crucial system called the Ubiquitin-Proteasome system, and it plays a significant role in how several plant hormones work.\nNow, here’s how it operates: In all cells, not just plant cells, there are proteins that need to be broken down when they’re no longer needed. This system marks these proteins for destruction by attaching a small molecule called ubiquitin to certain parts of the protein.\nTo identify which proteins need to be broken down, there’s a complex called E3 ubiquitin ligase. Think of it like a team leader. It uses something called an F-box protein to find the protein that needs to be broken down and position it properly for the ubiquitin molecule to attach.\nOnce the target protein is in the right position, an enzyme called E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme helps to add the ubiquitin molecule to the target protein. This marks it for destruction by the proteasome, which acts like a cell’s recycling center.\n\n\n6.1.4 Mechanisms of Auxin\nAuxin, a vital plant hormone, has various effects on plant growth, but it operates through an ancient and unified mechanism.\n\nNormally, genes that respond to auxin are switched off. This happens because a repressor protein (AUX/IAA) teams up with auxin response factors (ARFs).\nAuxin acts like a kind of glue. It brings together the repressor protein and another protein called TIR1, which is part of a larger complex called E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCF).\nOnce this complex forms, the repressor protein is marked for destruction by the ubiquitin proteasome system. When it’s broken down, the genes that respond to auxin can be turned on, and the plant can start doing what auxin is telling it to do.\n\nNow, here’s an interesting twist: there are different versions or isoforms of TIR1, AUX/IAA, and ARF proteins. Depending on which isoforms are present, auxin can produce various effects in the plant. This means that the same hormone can have different outcomes based on the specific combination of proteins involved. To understand these complex interactions, scientists use systems biology approaches to reveal how plants respond to auxin in different ways."

The step that determines how fast they’re made is controlled by an enzyme called Isopentenyltransferase (IPT).\nNow, where these cytokinins are made isn’t entirely clear, but we do know that some of them are produced in the roots and then travel up the plant through the xylem, which is like the plant’s plumbing system.\nWhen it’s time for these hormones to stop working, another enzyme called cytokinin oxidase (CKX) comes into play. It deactivates the cytokinins. So, these hormones are kind of like messengers in the plant, and when their job is done, CKX turns them off.\n\n6.2.1 Antagonism Between Cytokinins and Auxins\nCytokinins, which are important plant hormones, were actually discovered when scientists were working on tissue culture, a method for growing plants in a lab. They found a substance called kinetin, which is a product of DNA breakdown, could make plant cells grow into callus (a type of tissue).\nNow, when it comes to plant growth, the balance between auxin and cytokinin matters a lot. If there’s a lot of auxin and not much cytokinin around, the plant tends to form roots. On the other hand, if there’s plenty of cytokinin but less auxin, the plant leans toward making shoots (the upper parts of the plant). So, it’s like a seesaw: more auxin tips the balance toward root formation, while more cytokinin tips it toward shoot formation.\n\n6.2.1.1 What about in Plants?\n\n\n\n\n\nLabelled Plant Anatomy\n\n\n\n\nIn plants, cytokinin and auxin have different effects in different parts of the plant.\nIn the shoot, cytokinin encourages cell division in the apical meristem, which is like the plant’s growth center at the tip. On the other hand, auxin stops the development of side shoots called axillary buds.\nIn the root, it’s a bit like they switch roles. Cytokinin puts the brakes on cell division, while auxin actually encourages it.\nHere’s a bit of a technical explanation: The balance between these hormones depends on a protein called AUX/IAA, with one specific type called SHY2 being important. Cytokinin makes more of this protein, while auxin breaks it down. SHY2 then controls other processes by regulating the expression of certain proteins. It dampens the expression of PIN proteins, which affect how auxin is transported, and it boosts the production of IPT, which is needed for cytokinin production. So, these two hormones work in harmony but differently depending on the plant part and the levels of these proteins.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Decreasing Leaf Senescence\n\n\n\n\n\nImages of Tobacco Plants\n\n\n\n\nScientists conducted an interesting experiment with tobacco plants. They engineered these plants to produce more of a hormone called cytokinin, which is crucial for plant growth, especially in stressful conditions like drought.\nThe exciting part is that these engineered tobacco plants became much more resilient to drought. One reason for this was that they didn’t go through leaf senescence - the aging and wilting of leaves - as quickly when they lacked water.\nThis experiment teaches us a valuable lesson: in some situations, the way plants naturally respond to stress, like by aging and wilting, might not be ideal for agriculture. But the good news is that we can use genetic engineering to change how plants respond to stress, making them better suited for farming. So, it’s a bit like giving plants a superpower to withstand tough conditions.\n\n\n6.2.3 How do Cytokinins Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nInner Workings of Cytokinins\n\n\n\n\nCytokinin communicates with plant cells through a unique signaling pathway known as a phosphorelay two-component system.\nHere’s how it works:\n\nCytokinin attaches to a receptor on the outside of the cell.\nThis binding activates a kind of “messenger” within the cell called a histidine kinase.\nThe histidine kinase transfers a phosphate molecule (Pi) to a receiver domain within the cell and then to a soluble phosphotransfer protein.\nThis phosphotransfer protein travels into the cell’s nucleus, the control center of the cell, where it triggers a series of additional phosphorylation events. These events lead to changes in gene expression, essentially instructing the cell on what to do.\n\nIt’s crucial to understand that cytokinin alters gene regulation, but it does so through a completely different mechanism compared to auxin, showing the incredible diversity of how hormones can influence plant growth and development."

    "text": "6.3 Gibberelins\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Gibberlins\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a family of compounds found in plants, and although there are many of them (a whopping 136), not all are active.\nThese compounds are made through something called the terpenoid pathway, which is like a recipe for creating these molecules.\nNow, what do they do? Well, they play important roles in promoting plant growth and encouraging seeds to sprout. So, you can think of them as the plant’s way of saying, “Let’s grow and get those seeds going!”\n\n6.3.1 Gibberlein Causes Plant Growth\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants With and Without Gibberelic Acid\n\n\n\n\nThe story of gibberellic acid (GA) is pretty interesting. It was first discovered by Japanese scientists in the 1930s. They found that a fungus produced this compound, and when it got on rice plants, it made them grow super fast and tall. However, they grew so fast that they couldn’t support their own weight, and they fell over. This problem was humorously named foolish seedling disease.\nBut here’s the twist: it wasn’t until the 1950s that scientists realized GA is something that plants naturally produce inside themselves.\nNow, here’s why GA is important: when plants have mutations in the genes responsible for making or responding to GA, they end up looking like dwarfs. Their stems are short and sturdy, which is actually a good thing in agriculture. These sturdy stems are better at holding up the big, heavy seeds produced by crop plants. So, GA helps plants grow, but it can also be controlled to create more manageable and productive crops.\n\n\n6.3.2 How do Gibberelins Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Gibberelins Function\n\n\n\n\nGibberellic acid (GA) has a unique way of working inside plant cells:\n\nThere’s a special soluble receptor protein called GID1 that grabs onto GA when it’s around.\nThis GID1-GA duo then latches onto another protein called DELLA, which is like a stop sign for GA’s effects. DELLA is a negative regulator, meaning it slows down GA’s actions.\nNow, the GID1-GA-DELLA trio comes across an F-Box protein in a group known as E3 ubiquitin ligase (SCF). This F-Box protein adds multiple ubiquitin tags to the DELLA protein. These tags act like a “dispose of” label, targeting the DELLA protein for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system, essentially breaking it down.\nOnce DELLA is out of the picture, genes that were previously repressed by DELLA are free to be expressed. It’s like removing a roadblock, allowing these genes to carry out their functions. So, GA indirectly controls gene expression by getting rid of DELLA proteins when it’s time for those genes to be active.\n\nIn both cases - for auxins and gibberelin, the F-box protein shown in the above image is different. It’s TIR1 in auxin as opposed to SLY1 and SNE1 here.\n\n\n6.3.3 Green Revolution Plants\nThe “green revolution” in the 1960s was a game-changer for agriculture. It led to massive increases in crop yields, mainly because of two things: the use of semi-dwarf varieties of rice and wheat, and the application of more fertilizers.\nNow, here’s where gibberellic acid (GA) comes into play. In recent years, scientists have discovered that GA plays a crucial role in this agricultural transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Green Revolution Plants\n\n\n\n\nIn rice, there’s a gene called sd1 (semi-dwarf 1). This gene encodes an enzyme that’s involved in the production of GA. When there’s less active GA around because of mutations in this gene, rice plants grow shorter, which is actually a good thing because they are less likely to fall over, and they can support more grains.\nIn wheat, there’s a gene called rht (reduced height). This gene encodes a DELLA protein, and this protein is typically broken down in the presence of GA, allowing plants to grow tall. But in some semi-dwarf wheat varieties, the DELLA protein can’t be degraded as it should. This messes up GA signaling and results in shorter wheat plants, which again is beneficial for agriculture because they are sturdier and can handle the weight of their grains better.\nSo, it turns out that GA and genes related to it have been key players in the success of the “green revolution” and the increased productivity of crops."

They were actually discovered when scientists were looking for substances that promote growth in plants.\nThese steroids are made through a pathway called the terpenoid pathway, sort of like a recipe for their production.\nThey play a crucial role in plant development. When there are mutations in the genes responsible for making these steroids, plants end up looking dwarfed or smaller than usual. So, you can think of brassinosteroids as important hormones that help plants grow and develop properly.\n\n6.4.1 How do Brassinosteroids Work?\nBrassinosteroids, these plant steroid hormones, work through a pretty interesting process involving some key players.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Simplified Mechanism Behind Brassinosteroids\n\n\n\n\nFirst, there’s a receptor called BRI1 that’s attached to the cell’s membrane. When there’s no signal telling the plant to grow, a kinase protein called BIN2 comes into play. This kinase does a little chemical handshake with some transcription factors, essentially making them inactive.\nBut when the plant receives the signal that it’s time to grow, like when brassinosteroids are present, a whole series of chemical reactions happen. This leads to the deactivation of BIN2. When BIN2 is inactive, it can’t mess with those transcription factors anymore, so they become active, which means they’re ready to get to work.\n\n\n6.4.2 Signalling in Membranes and Endosomes\nWhen brassinosteroids send their growth signal to a plant cell, a cool thing happens through a process called endocytosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nEndosomes Formed from Endocytosis\n\n\n\n\nEndocytosis creates tiny structures called endosomes, and these little compartments contain the receptors BRI1 and BAK1. These endosomes then travel around inside the cell’s cytoplasm and continue to send signals.\nThis is pretty neat because it means that even parts of the cell membrane far away from the cell’s central command (the nucleus) can still get the message to grow.\nAnd here’s the bonus: the receptors aren’t wasted. After they’ve done their job, they get recycled back to the cell membrane, ready to catch the next growth signal that comes their way. So, it’s like they’re good at their job and eco-friendly too!"

It’s like the plant’s way of saying, “I’m ready to be delicious!”\n\n\n\n\n\nFlowers Treated With and Without Ethylene\n\n\n\n\nEthylene also has another job. It promotes things like leaf shedding (called abscission) and the natural aging of flowers (flower senescence).\n\n\n\n\n\nRipening of Tomatoes Due to Ethylene\n\n\n\n\nIn farming and food storage, ethylene is used to speed up the ripening of fruits. Think of it like a fruit fast-forward button. But if you want to slow things down, you can store fruit in an environment with lots of carbon dioxide (CO2), which reduces ethylene production and slows down the ripening process.\nAnd here’s a cool trick: scientists have found ways to delay flower aging by using substances like sodium thiosulphate and diazocyclopentadiene. These chemicals bind to the ethylene receptor, kind of like putting a lock on it, so it can’t do its job and make the flowers age as quickly. So, ethylene is like the conductor of the plant’s symphony of ripening and aging, and we can fine-tune its effects to our advantage in agriculture.\n\n6.5.1 How does Ethylene Work?\n\n\n\n\n\nEthylene Signalling Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nWhen there’s no ethylene around, a protein called CTR steps in. It binds to the ethylene receptor and starts a process where other molecules get tagged with little phosphate groups in a cascade of chemical reactions. This tagging, called phosphorylation, acts like a “do not disturb” sign for transcription, which is the process of making proteins based on the instructions in genes.\nBut when ethylene comes into the picture and binds to the receptor, it’s like a key that unlocks CTR from the receptor. This release of CTR allows transcription to happen. So, in simple terms, ethylene acts as a switch that turns on the process of making proteins based on certain genes."

    "text": "6.6 Abscisic Acid (i.e. ABA)\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Abscisic Acid\n\n\n\n\nAbscisic acid (ABA) is like the sleepytime hormone for plants. It’s made through a process called the terpenoid pathway.\nOne of its main jobs is to tell seeds it’s time to take a nap, or in other words, establish seed dormancy. This dormancy helps seeds survive until they’re in the right conditions to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlants Wilting Under the Hot Sun\n\n\n\n\nBut ABA also has another important role. It works as a signal during stressful times in a plant’s life. When things like drought or extreme temperatures happen, ABA steps in and tells the plant to slow down its growth and conserve water.\n\n6.6.1 Seed Dormancy by ABA and GA\nIn some maize mutants lacking ABA (abscisic acid), something interesting happens – they become viviparous, which means their seeds start to sprout even before they leave the parent plant.\nABA usually acts like a “do not disturb” sign for seeds, preventing them from germinating prematurely. But when ABA is missing, seeds can’t resist the urge to sprout.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorn Kernels Under the Influence of Abscisic Acid\n\n\n\n\nTo break seed dormancy and allow germination to happen, a hormone called gibberellic acid (GA) steps in. But here’s the catch: GA and ABA are like rivals. They work against each other. The balance between these two hormones controls whether a seed stays dormant or starts to grow.\nIn fact, GA is so good at making seeds sprout that it’s used by the brewing industry to help barley seeds germinate for beer production. So, you can think of ABA and GA as the plant’s internal seesaw, deciding when it’s time for seeds to wake up and grow.\n\n\n6.6.2 ABA Production Under Stress\n\n\n\n\n\nABA Content Under Water Deprivation\n\n\n\n\nWhen a plant faces a drought, it goes into high gear to produce more ABA (abscisic acid). ABA is like the plant’s superhero in times of drought.\nWhen ABA levels are high, it sends a signal to the stomata, which are tiny openings in the leaves. These stomata are responsible for breathing, but they also let out water through a process called transpiration. High ABA levels act like a traffic cop, telling the stomata to close up shop and reduce water loss. It’s the plant’s way of saying, “We need to conserve water right now!”\nInterestingly, ABA isn’t just made in the leaves; the roots can produce it too. And when the roots make ABA, it can travel up to the leaves through the xylem, like a plant’s internal communication system.\nNow, here’s something cool: there are some mutants, often called wilty, that can’t make ABA. These plants can only thrive in humid conditions because they can’t effectively conserve water during droughts.\nScientists have been trying to figure out how ABA does its superhero job, and they’ve proposed a bunch of candidates for the ABA receptor – like who ABA talks to in the plant cells. But it’s a bit of a mystery, and there’s still some debate among scientists about the exact details."

    "text": "6.7 Jasmonic Acid\nWhen a plant gets nibbled on by hungry insects that chew on its leaves, it doesn’t just sit there and take it. It fights back! This defense mechanism is called “induced defense.”\nOne of the superheroes behind this defense is a hormone called Jasmonic acid, or JA for short. Within just 30 minutes of a plant getting nibbled, the levels of JA shoot up like a rocket.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Jasmonic Acid\n\n\n\n\nJA is like the general of the plant’s army. It signals the plant to activate a bunch of genes that are all about defense. These genes kickstart processes like making special chemicals (secondary metabolism) and producing proteins that mess with the digestion of the herbivores (think of them as plant bodyguards, like bouncers at a club). These proteins are called protease inhibitors.\n\n6.7.1 How is Jasmonic Acid Made?\n\n\n\n\n\nBiosynthesis of Jasmonic Acid\n\n\n\n\nMaking Jasmonic acid (JA) in plants is a bit like a treasure hunt spread across different parts of the plant.\nIt all starts with linolenic acid, which is a type of fat found in the plant’s cell membranes. This linolenic acid is like a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered.\nBut to turn this treasure into active JA, there’s a crucial step. JA needs to team up with an amino acid called isoleucine. This partnership is what makes JA bioactive, like unlocking its superpowers.\nBut here’s the cool part: JA doesn’t just stay in one spot. It moves throughout the plant using a special plant highway called the phloem. It travels to different parts of the plant and tells them, “Hey, we’re under attack, gear up for defense!” So, it’s not just a local response; it’s a whole-plant response to keep those leaf-chomping insects at bay.\n\n\n6.7.2 JA Signalling\nThe way Jasmonic acid (JA) signals in plants is like a secret handshake club. It’s surprisingly similar to how another hormone called auxin signals.\n\n\n\n\n\nJA Signalling Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how it works: JA gets a makeover and becomes JA-Ile, which is like a secret code. JA-Ile acts like a special glue, helping a JAZ repressor protein attach to an F-box protein called COI1, which is part of a complex known as the E3 ubiquitin ligase.\nOnce the JAZ repressor is stuck to COI1, it’s tagged with a label called ubiquitin, like a “kick me” sign. Then, it’s sent to the proteasome, which is like the plant’s recycling center. There, the JAZ repressor gets broken down into its building blocks.\nWith the JAZ repressor out of the way, the plant can finally turn on the genes it needs for defense or other important tasks. It’s like opening the gates for action in the plant’s superhero squad.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide by Side Comparison of Auxin and JA Signalling Mechanism\n\n\n\n\nNo matter which hormone we’re talking about, when it binds to its special receptor, it sets off a chain reaction. This reaction sends a repressor (a bit like a traffic cop) to a special E3 ubiquitin ligase complex known as SCF. This complex is like a control center.\nOnce the repressor gets to SCF, it’s like a green light for destruction. SCF tags the repressor with a label called ubiquitin, and off it goes to the plant’s recycling center, the proteasome. There, the repressor gets broken down into its basic parts.\nNow, what makes these hormones so amazing is that, even though they use this similar method to silence the repressor, they each have their own unique jobs and effects in the plant. So, whether it’s about growth, defense, or some other important task, each hormone has its own special mission."

In fact, about 70% of the total plant material on Earth comes from plant cell walls.\nWhen you think about trees, for example, most of what you see is their cell walls. If plants didn’t have cell walls, trees would look more like gooey, blobby things rather than the strong and tall giants we’re familiar with.\nThink of the cell wall as a bit like the skin of a plant cell. Just like our skin holds us together and gives us our shape, the cell wall plays a similar role for plant cells.\nAll plant cells have this strong primary cell wall that surrounds them. This wall helps determine the shape and function of the cell. Imagine if a plant cell were like a balloon, and the cell wall was the rubbery part that kept it from getting too big and floppy.\nOne important job of the cell wall is to make sure the cell doesn’t soak up too much water. It acts like a barrier to prevent the cell from swelling up like a water balloon.\nBut here’s the cool part: the cell wall isn’t just for protection. It’s also like armor against bad guys. It acts as a tough shield that keeps out pathogens (like plant diseases) and other harmful invaders.\nIn some cells, they create extra strong walls inside the basic wall. These extra walls are called secondary walls, and they’re like extra layers of protection.\nThe primary walls, which come first when cells are growing, are pretty thin and not very complex in structure. They’re like the starting point for a cell’s outer layer.\nWhen you have neighboring cells, the part that sticks them together is known as the Middle Lamella. Think of it as a sort of glue that holds the cells together.\nSometimes, after the cells have grown to their full size, they build these specialized secondary walls inside the primary walls. These secondary walls can be super unique and different in how they’re made and what they’re made of."

    "text": "7.1 Revision on Sugars\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of an Anomeric Carbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of an Anomeric Carbon\n\n\n\n\nWhen we talk about sugars, there’s something interesting that happens. You see, these sugars can change their shape, a bit like opening and closing a ring. This change in shape creates two different forms, which we call alpha (α) and beta (β) conformations, at a special carbon called the anomeric carbon.\nNow, here’s the twist. Once these sugars join together to make a bigger sugar chain, we can’t change their shape anymore. It’s like they get locked into one of these alpha or beta forms, and they stay that way.\n\n7.1.1 Sugar Polymerization\nSugars, which are like building blocks in the cell wall, connect to each other through a specific carbon called the anomeric carbon and another part of sugar called a hydroxyl group. This connection is known as a glycosidic linkage, and it’s always in the form of a ring.\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Starch\n\n\n\n\nNow, the special thing is that the type of connection is determined by which carbon the hydroxyl group is attached to and whether it’s in the alpha (α) or beta (β) conformation at the anomeric carbon. This makes a big difference in how these sugars link up.\nYou might think there are endless ways to connect these sugars because there are so many types of sugar pieces and combinations. It seems like it could get super complex. But, luckily, the major components of the cell wall tend to stick to certain patterns, so there’s some order in all this sugar mixing. ## Cell Wall Biomolecules\n\n\n7.1.2 Cellulose\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Cellulose\n\n\n\n\nCellulose is a super common type of sugar in plants. It’s the most abundant one. When these cellulose sugars get together, they form something called paracrystalline microfibrils. These microfibrils are like tiny structures made up of around 36 chains of cellulose all holding hands, or more accurately, they’re bonded together by something called hydrogen bonds.\nEach of these cellulose chains is quite long, made up of anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 individual sugar pieces. That’s a lot of sugars in one chain! The interesting thing is that these chains can start and stop in different places within the microfibril. So, inside one of these microfibrils, there can be thousands of these cellulose chains, all doing their thing. It’s like a big, complex group of sugars working together.\n\n7.1.2.1 Cellulosic Scaffolds\n\n\n\n\n\nCellulose Scaffolds\n\n\n\n\nIn the plant cell, there’s something really cool happening with a structure called the cellulosic scaffold. It’s like a framework made of cellulose, a type of sugar. But it’s not just plain cellulose; there are other sugars involved, like hemi-celluloses, that act as cross-linking glycans.\nThese cross-linking glycans are like a protective coating around the microfibrils, which are those tiny cellulose structures we talked about earlier. They also connect to other glycans and bridge the gap between microfibrils.\nNow, there are two specific types of these cross-linking glycans: Xyloglucans (XyGs) and Glucoronoarabinoxylans (GAXs). Xyloglucans are long chains made of glucose, just like cellulose, but they have bits of xylose sugar linked at regular intervals. On the other hand, Glucoronoarabinoxylans are also long chains of xylose, but they have side branches that connect to glucuronic acid and arabinose. So, it’s like different types of sugars coming together to create this strong and interconnected structure in plant cells.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Pectins\n\n\n\n\n\nPectin Monomers\n\n\n\n\nPectins are some of the most soluble carbohydrates found in a plant’s cell wall. They’re not all the same; in fact, they’re quite diverse. Think of them as a bit like a tangled web – they’re branched and hold a lot of water, making them very hydrated. This unique structure plays a big role in determining how porous or holey the cell wall is.\nWhat makes pectins even more interesting is that they’re packed with a type of sugar called D-galacturonic acid. These pectins are found in high amounts in a part of the cell wall called the middle lamella, and they’re in charge of making sure cells stick together. It’s like they’re the glue that holds plant cells in place.\nOne more thing about pectins – they can link to each other in a special way, kind of like forming a gel. You might notice this in jams and jellies. When you heat fruit with pectins and then let it cool, they help create that jelly-like texture, giving it the perfect consistency for your favorite spreads.\n\n\n7.1.4 Structural Proteins\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural Protein Examples\n\n\n\n\nInside the cell wall, there are special proteins that play important roles in giving the wall its structure. These proteins belong to different classes and are often named after the amino acids that are most common in them.\nOne class is called Hydroxyproline rich glycoproteins, which includes something called extensins. Then, there are Proline rich proteins and Glycine rich proteins. Another class, Arabinogalactan proteins or AGPs for short, are really interesting because they can be up to 90% carbohydrate, which is like sugar.\nNow, these proteins have a job to do. One of their possible functions is to help shape and hold the cell wall in place. Think of them as the builders and architects of the plant cell’s strong outer layer, making sure it’s all put together just right."

Imagine it like a well-organized building plan.\nThe primary cell wall has a fundamental framework made of cellulose microfibrils, which are like strong fibers, and cross-linking glycans that act like connectors. These elements come together to create a sort of scaffold.\nNow, this scaffold is surrounded by a network of pectic polysaccharides, which are like a supportive web, giving the cell wall additional structure and texture.\nBut there’s more to it. Structural proteins play their part by forming a third network within the cell wall. It’s like they’re an extra layer of support, like steel beams in a building.\nLastly, cell walls can be grouped into two main types based on what they’re made of. These differences in composition make them either Type 1 or Type 2 cell walls. Think of it like sorting cell walls into two categories depending on what they’re built from.\n\n7.2.1 Types of Cell Walls\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Cell Walls\n\n\n\n\nLet’s dive into the two main types of cell walls, Type I and Type II, and see what sets them apart.\n\nType I Cell Walls\nIn Type I cell walls, you’ll find something called XyG, which helps to link different parts together. These walls have an extensive matrix of pectin, which acts like a supporting structure. Plus, there are lots of structural proteins, like the builders of the wall, working hard. Interestingly, Type I cell walls don’t have a specific network involving phenolic compounds.\nType II Cell Walls\nNow, when it comes to Type II cell walls, they’re a bit different. Instead of XyG, they use GAX to link things up. These walls have fewer pectins, so it’s not as rich in that supportive matrix. Structural proteins are not as abundant as in Type I. What’s unique about Type II cell walls is the presence of a phenolic network, mainly made up of hydroxycinnamic acids. It’s like an additional layer of protection or reinforcement, making these cell walls distinct from Type I."

    "text": "7.3 Cell Wall Synthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembling a Cell Wall at the Organelle Level\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a cell wall is a bit like putting together a puzzle where each piece is made in a different factory.\nFirst, we have cellulose, which is like the main building material of the cell wall. This is made right at the plasma membrane, which is like the cell’s outer skin.\nThen, there are components like pectins and hemicellulose. These are produced in a part of the cell called the Golgi apparatus. Think of the Golgi apparatus as a factory that specializes in making these important pieces.\nProteins, on the other hand, are created in the endoplasmic reticulum. Once they’re made, they get a little extra sugar added to them in the Golgi apparatus, a process called glycosylation.\nNow, to put everything together, the cell uses tiny transportation vehicles called vesicles. These vesicles carry the different pieces, including cellulose, pectins, hemicellulose, and the modified proteins, to where the cell wall is being formed. It’s like a well-coordinated team effort to construct the cell wall.\n\n7.3.1 Building Cellulose Microfibrils\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrofibril Synthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe process begins at the plasma membrane, which is like the cell’s outer skin. Here, there’s a special protein called cellulose synthase. It’s like a tiny factory that creates cellulose.\nThis cellulose synthase makes what we call rosettes. These are like groups of machines working together, and they take a special type of sugar called UDP-glucose, which comes from sucrose, and turn it into cellulose.\nTo help guide these rosettes, microtubules come into play. Microtubules are like tracks that direct the movement of the cellulose synthase complexes, making sure they create cellulose in the right places. It’s a bit like a train track for these cellulose-making machines.\n\n\n7.3.2 Incorporating New Cell Wall Polymers\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Wall Growth\n\n\n\n\nPlant cells have a unique way of growing. They can get much larger – sometimes thousands of times their original size – while keeping their cell wall thickness constant. The force driving this expansion is called turgor pressure, a bit like blowing up a balloon. It pushes the cell outward.\nNow, the rate at which a cell grows is carefully controlled. It’s like a well-managed construction project. The cell regulates its growth by a process called wall loosening. This means it separates the microfibrils, which are like tiny building blocks, and adds new polymers. These polymers are fresh materials that help the cell wall expand. So, it’s like taking apart some bricks and adding new ones to make the wall bigger.\nMost cells grow evenly, like inflating a balloon, but some have a different style. They display tip growth, which is when only one end of the cell gets longer. Think of it like a balloon that’s being inflated more at one end than the other. This tip growth happens in special cells like root hairs and pollen tubes, and it’s essential for their functions.\n\n\n7.3.3 Cell Walll Loosening\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Wall Loosening\n\n\n\n\nThere are special enzymes involved in this process. One of them is called Xyloglucan endotransglycosylase, or XET for short. XET can do something really interesting – it can cut and reattach XyG chains. This ability allows for a temporary slipping or shifting of microfibrils, those tiny building blocks in the cell wall. It’s like rearranging bricks to make space for expansion.\nAnother set of enzymes, called Expansins, have a less clear function, but they seem to play a role in breaking hydrogen bonds between cellulose and cross-linking glycans. It’s a bit like dismantling the connections between parts of the cell wall, which helps in cell expansion. These Expansins are pretty unique because they are the only enzymes known to cause cell expansion in a lab setting. So, they have a special job in the cell wall loosening process."

    "text": "7.4 Secondary Cell Walls\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of a Secondary Cell Wall\n\n\n\n\nAfter the primary cell wall is in place, certain cells go a step further by creating something called secondary cell walls.\nThese secondary walls are a bit different. They contain more cellulose compared to the primary wall, making them stronger and more rigid. They are also filled with a substance called lignin, which is a complex polymer made from smaller building blocks known as phenylpropanoid subunits.\nLignin forms a hydrophobic, or water-repelling, network that is physically interwoven with the matrix polysaccharides in the cell wall. This makes the secondary wall tough and resistant. It’s like adding a protective layer to the cell.\nHowever, this toughness has a downside. It makes plant materials less digestible. So, while the secondary cell wall provides extra strength, it also makes it harder for animals to break down and digest the plant.\n\n7.4.1 Importance of Cell Walls\nCell walls are actually quite important for us, and here’s why:\nFirstly, they serve as a massive carbon sink. This means that they can store a lot of carbon, which is essential for addressing climate change. When we think of carbon storage, we might picture vast forests and woodlands – and indeed, wood, which is made up of cell walls, is a significant contributor to this carbon storage.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing CelL Walls to Make Biofuel\n\n\n\n\nWe also rely on cell walls for a variety of practical purposes. They are used in the construction of buildings and as fuel sources. Paper is another everyday item that wouldn’t exist without cell walls. Additionally, cell walls are considered valuable feedstock for biofuels. When we’re talking about biofuels, we mean fuels made from natural resources, like plant material, rather than fossil fuels.\nLooking ahead, the field of biotechnology is exploring ways to make cell walls more accessible and easier to digest. This opens up exciting possibilities for the future. It could lead to innovations in energy production, materials, and even new ways of using plants in our daily lives. So, cell walls have a big role in both the present and the future."

    "text": "7.5 Lipids\nPlant lipids are a diverse group of molecules that really like to hang out in non-water-based solvents, which makes them different from many other substances in plants.\nNow, these lipids have some important jobs in the plant world. For starters, they’re crucial for building cell membranes. The two main types of lipids involved in this are phospholipids and glycolipids. Together, they create a kind of waterproof barrier around cells, like a protective shield.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Gain From Burning Fat versus Sugar\n\n\n\n\nLipids also serve as energy storage units in plants. When you burn lipids, you get more energy than from carbohydrates, which makes them super efficient for energy storage. And because they’re not very water-friendly, they don’t trap as much water as carbohydrates, so they provide more energy for their weight.\nThere’s also a plant called Elaeis guineensis, which is the most productive oil crop globally. It’s like the superstar of oil production in the plant kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture of Elaeis guineensis\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, plants use fatty acids found in lipids to create waxes that coat and shield them from the environment. Think of it like plants wearing a protective coat to stay safe.\nLastly, lipids have a role in creating jasmonic acid, which helps plants defend themselves against insects. So, they’re not just structural and energy storage molecules; they’re also part of a plant’s defense system.\n\n7.5.1 Lipid Structure and Naming\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming Conventions and Structures of Lipids\n\n\n\n\nLipids often consist of fatty acids joined to glycerol. Fatty acids are named in a specific way. Their name tells us about their structure.\nThe name of a fatty acid tells us two things: the number of carbon atoms it has and the number and position of double bonds. For instance, if a fatty acid has 18 carbon atoms and 2 double bonds, it would be called “18:2.”\nThe subscript in the name also indicates where these double bonds are located in unsaturated fatty acids. If the double bonds have a “cis” orientation, it’s denoted as “c,” while “trans” orientation is labeled as “t.” Trans isomers are pretty rare in nature.\nSo, when you see a name like “18:2 c,” it means the fatty acid has 18 carbon atoms, 2 double bonds, and the double bonds have a “cis” orientation. This naming system helps scientists understand the structure of different fatty acids in lipids.\n\n\n7.5.2 Glyceroglycolipids and Glycerophospholipids\nPlant cells use different types of lipids to build their membranes, and this has some interesting implications.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Glyceroglycolipids and Glycerophospholipids\n\n\n\n\nFirst, there are glycerophospholipids. These are found in most plant membranes and are also the dominant lipids in animal membranes. They make up a significant part of the structural foundation of these membranes.\nThen, there are glyceroglycolipids. These are especially associated with chloroplast membranes, which are the green structures in plant cells responsible for photosynthesis. It’s like they have their own special kind of lipids.\nWhat’s intriguing is that in some plant leaves, up to 75% of the total membrane lipids are glyceroglycolipids. This might be a clever adaptation because it reduces the plant’s reliance on a valuable nutrient, phosphate. By using glyceroglycolipids, plants might be saving precious resources, and this could be particularly important in nutrient-poor environments. So, the choice of lipids in membranes can have a big impact on how plants manage their resources."

    "section": "7.6 Fatty Acid Biosynthesis",
    "text": "7.6 Fatty Acid Biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nBiosynthesis of Fatty Acids\n\n\n\n\nThe process of fatty acid biosynthesis happens through a series of steps, involving cycles of adding two carbon atoms at a time.\n\nThe first critical step starts with acetyl CoA, a molecule with two carbon atoms. It gets transformed into malonyl CoA, which has three carbon atoms. This step is crucial because it commits the plant to making fatty acids.\nThe malonyl group is then moved to another molecule called acyl carrier protein (ACP).\nMalonyl ACP combines with acetyl CoA, and this process releases carbon dioxide (CO2).\nIn the following steps, the keto group in the molecule is reduced to create a hydrocarbon. Malonyl ACP is mixed with the substrate to add another two carbon atoms. These new carbons are then reduced, and the process continues, with malonyl ACP being added repeatedly. This cycle continues until we have a fatty acid chain with 16 to 18 carbon atoms.\n\nThese condensation reactions, where molecules come together to build the fatty acid, are made possible by an enzyme called 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase, often referred to as KAS.\n\n7.6.1 Acyl Carrier Protein\nDuring the process of fatty acid synthesis, special carrier proteins come into play to transport the intermediates, which are the in-between products of this complex process.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Acyl Carrier Proteins\n\n\n\n\nOne of these carrier proteins is called acyl carrier protein (ACP). It’s a relatively small protein, consisting of 80 to 90 amino acids. What’s really cool about ACP is that it has a phosphopantetheine linker. This linker acts like a flexible bridge, allowing the fatty acid intermediates to move around and access different enzyme sites where they undergo further processing. It’s a bit like a transportation system within the cell.\nTo make things even more efficient, the enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis work together as a team. They form a complex called Fatty Acid Synthase, where all the active sites are close to each other. In plants and bacteria, the enzymatic activities are organized into separate chains, while in animals, they’re part of a single, long protein chain. Regardless of this organizational difference, the reactions themselves are essentially the same. So, these carrier proteins and enzyme complexes are like choreographers in a well-coordinated dance, ensuring that the fatty acids are made efficiently and accurately.\n\n\n7.6.2 KAS Isoforms\nCreating new carbon-carbon bonds is a key part of making fatty acids, and different enzymes are responsible for forming these bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\nKAS Isoforms\n\n\n\n\nIn all plants, you can find three versions, or isoforms, of an enzyme called 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase. These enzymes are responsible for what we call “condensing,” which is the process of bringing different pieces together to form the carbon-carbon bonds.\nEach of these isoforms has a specific job because they are picky about the types of molecules they work with.\n\nKAS III: This one prefers to work with acetyl CoA, a molecule with two carbon atoms. It’s like the starter in the fatty acid-making process. When it gets going, it initiates the whole fatty acid synthesis.\nKAS I: KAS I is most active when it’s dealing with acyl ACPs that have carbon chains ranging from 4 to 14 carbon atoms. It’s like the middleman in the process, dealing with medium-sized pieces.\nKAS II: KAS II, on the other hand, only works with long carbon chains, specifically those containing 10 to 16 carbon atoms. It’s like the closer, completing the final stages of fatty acid synthesis.\n\nThese isoforms are like a team of specialized workers, each with their specific role, ensuring that fatty acids are made correctly with the right carbon-carbon bonds.\n\n\n7.6.3 Making Long Chain Fatty Acids\nProducing long-chain fatty acids is quite an intricate process and relies on specialized elongase systems.\nSome fatty acids can be quite long, with chains extending to C20 and C22, while waxes are made from even longer C26 to C32 fatty acids.\nIn the plastid, where fatty acid synthesis mainly takes place, the process typically yields C18 fatty acids, but what about the longer ones? Well, that’s where a different system comes into play. To create these longer fatty acids, a cytosolic membrane-bound elongase system is used.\nThis elongase system involves a series of reactions similar to those in fatty acid synthesis, but it doesn’t require the acyl carrier protein (ACP). Instead, there are specific enzymes involved:\n\nKCS – 3-ketoacyl CoA synthase\nKR – 3-ketoacyl CoA reductase\nDH - 3-ketoacyl CoA dehydrogenase\nER – enoyl-CoA reductase\n\nThese enzymes work together to extend the fatty acid chain. However, these elongase systems are relatively less understood compared to other parts of fatty acid metabolism, making them an interesting area for further research.\n\n\n7.6.4 Unusual Fatty Acids\n\n\n\n\n\nUnusual Fatty Acids\n\n\n\n\nThe world of fatty acids is incredibly diverse, with hundreds of unusual ones that aren’t found in many plant species. What’s intriguing is that these unique fatty acids are often discovered in the seed oils of only a few specific plant species. This distribution pattern suggests that these fatty acids may have evolved independently multiple times, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\nThese unusual fatty acids serve various purposes, and one of them might be defense. Some of these fatty acids could be toxic or difficult for animals to digest, serving as a way to protect the plant from herbivores.\nInterestingly, the enzymes responsible for making these unique fatty acids closely resemble the standard fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes. It’s as though evolution has found it relatively easy to modify these enzymes to perform new tasks. For example, it appears that evolving the ability to add hydroxyl groups (a type of oxygen and hydrogen combination) to a fatty acid chain can happen from enzymes that were originally involved in adding double bonds. This adaptability in enzyme function is part of the amazing diversity of life and the unique ways that plants adapt to their environments."

    "section": "7.7 Stopping Fatty Acid Biosynthesis",
    "text": "7.7 Stopping Fatty Acid Biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\n\nFatty Acid Biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe process of fatty acid biosynthesis doesn’t go on forever; it has a planned ending. To wrap it up, there are specific enzymes that come into play.\nIn plants, there are two types of thioesterases, which are enzymes that help complete the process:\n\nFatA: This thioesterase is most active with a fatty acid called 18:1$$9. It’s like the one in charge of finalizing the longer unsaturated fatty acids.\nFatB: On the other hand, FatB is more active with shorter and saturated fatty acids. It’s like the specialist for shorter fatty acids.\n\nNow, once the fatty acid has been properly prepared, it’s time to move it out of the plastid, which is a part of the cell where this whole process takes place. However, the exact mechanism for how this is done remains a bit of a mystery, as it’s not entirely clear how the fatty acid is targeted and transported out of the plastid. It’s like the final stage of this journey still has some secrets to be uncovered.\n\n7.7.1 Plant Fatty Acid Biosynthesis in the Grander Scheme\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant Fatty Acid Biosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe process of fatty acid biosynthesis in plants is a part of a broader field of biochemistry, and it shares some common features with other organisms.\nOne fascinating thing is that the biochemistry of fatty acid biosynthesis is quite similar across different life forms. In animals and fungi, for instance, this process takes place in the cytoplasm, which is a part of the cell, and it’s orchestrated by a giant enzyme called fatty acid synthase. This mega-enzyme handles all the different enzymatic activities required for fatty acid production.\nBut what’s even more interesting is how variations of this fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are used by bacteria and fungi to create various compounds called polyketides. These polyketides are a diverse group of molecules, and some of them are famous for being antibiotics. This means that the same pathway plants use to make fatty acids can be adapted to produce a wide range of other useful compounds in different organisms.\n\n\n7.7.2 Importance of Fatty Acid Desaturation\nFatty acid desaturation, or the process of adding double bonds to fatty acid chains, plays a crucial role in maintaining the right properties for various functions in plants.\nWhen cis double bonds are introduced into the fatty acid chains, they create “kinks” or bends in the chains. These kinks are like little twists in the fatty acid structure, and they have a significant impact. They reduce the tight packing of the chains, making the membranes more fluid. This increased fluidity is essential for the proper functioning of cell membranes.\nFor example, consider stearic acid, a fatty acid with no double bonds (18:0). It has a melting point at 69 degrees Celsius. In contrast, oleic acid, which has one double bond (18:1Δ9), has a much lower melting point at 13.4 degrees Celsius. This difference in melting points is because of the kinks created by the double bond, which makes the oleic acid more fluid at lower temperatures.\nIn most plant tissues, more than 75% of the fatty acids are unsaturated, meaning they have these kinks due to double bonds. To achieve this, many of the 18:0 fatty acids, which are saturated (no double bonds), are converted into 18:1Δ9. This conversion is carried out by an enzyme called soluble stearoyl-ACP desaturase.\n\n7.7.2.1 Arabidopsis Fab2 Mutant\n\n\n\n\n\nArabidopsis Fab2 Mutant\n\n\n\n\nThis mutant has a problem with its stearoyl-ACP Δ9 desaturase, an enzyme responsible for adding double bonds to fatty acids. As a result, the fab2 mutant has higher levels of 18:0 fatty acids, which are saturated and lack double bonds.\nThe most interesting thing about this mutant is its appearance. It has a miniature phenotype, which means it doesn’t grow as big as regular plants. Specifically, the mesophyll and epidermal cells in this mutant fail to enlarge, which affects its overall size and shape.\nHowever, there’s a twist to this story. When these mutant plants are grown at a higher temperature, around 35 degrees Celsius, some of the issues with their size can be partially overcome. This happens because the increase in temperature makes the cell membrane more fluid, which helps the cells function better. It’s like how some things work smoother when it’s warmer.\n\n\n\n7.7.3 More on Desaturases\n\n\n\n\n\nEffects of Desaturase on Plant Phenotype\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to fatty acid desaturases, there’s something interesting to note. Most of these enzymes are found in the cell’s membranes, and they typically work on glycerolipids, which are molecules found in the plastid.\nTo create glycerolipids in the plastid, a fatty acid is moved from acyl-ACP to glycerol-3-phosphate. This process is like assembling the building blocks for these lipids.\nIn plants, like Arabidopsis, there are seven more desaturases known as FAD2-FAD8. These enzymes are located in the membranes of the chloroplasts or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), another part of the cell. What makes them special is that they add additional double bonds to the fatty acids. These extra double bonds have a big impact on the physical properties of the membranes they create.\nStudying these enzymes biochemically can be quite challenging, but scientists have managed to create genetic mutants for all of them. Interestingly, when you disrupt the function of these enzymes, the plant becomes unable to grow through photosynthesis. Instead, it relies on external sources of energy like sucrose to survive. This highlights the critical role of polyunsaturated membranes, which these enzymes help create, in the photosynthesis process. So, these desaturases play a vital role in the plant’s ability to capture and use light energy."

    "text": "7.8 Storage Lipids\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Storage Lipids\n\n\n\n\nWhen plants create storage lipids in their seeds and pollen, the process is quite fascinating.\nFirst, the fatty acids they produce in the plastid are transported out of the plastid to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), another part of the cell. Once there, these fatty acids become part of a dynamic pool. This means they can move around and undergo various acyl exchange and transferase reactions, essentially shuffling themselves around.\nFinally, these fatty acids are gathered and packed into subcellular organelles known as oil bodies. It’s like the plant’s way of storing these valuable molecules in a secure and organized manner. These oil bodies are the plant’s storage vaults for energy-rich triglycerides (TAGs), where they’re saved until they’re needed, such as for seed germination or pollen growth. So, it’s a well-coordinated process, from fatty acid creation in the plastid to storage in oil bodies.\n\n7.8.1 Oil Bodies\nOil bodies, which are like storage compartments for fats in plant cells, are structured in an interesting way.\n\n\n\n\n\nPicture of an Oil Body\n\n\n\n\nThese oil bodies are enclosed by a single-layer membrane. This membrane is special because it’s made up of phospholipids, and it has a unique orientation. The hydrophilic (water-attracting) head groups of these phospholipids face the cytosol, which is the watery interior of the cell. Meanwhile, the acyl moieties, which are the hydrophobic (water-repelling) parts, interact with the hydrophobic TAG (triglyceride) cargo, which is essentially the stored fat.\nIn addition to the membrane, there’s a small protein called Oleosin that plays a key role. Oleosin is embedded within this monolayer membrane. It has a hydrophobic middle domain, which is like the part of the protein that prefers the fatty TAGs. This middle domain interacts with the stored fats in the oil bodies, helping to regulate the size of these storage compartments. So, the unique structure and the presence of Oleosin make these oil bodies an efficient and well-organized storage system for fats in plant cells."

    "text": "8.1 Nitrogen\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics on Nitrogen\n\n\n\n\nNitrogen is a crucial element in the world of biology. It’s actually the fourth most abundant element across all living things.\nEven though there’s a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere, it’s not in a form that most organisms can use directly. The nitrogen in the air is locked up in a molecule with a triple bond between nitrogen atoms, which makes it very stable. To make it accessible to plants and other organisms, this triple bond needs to be broken. This process is called nitrogen fixation, and it results in the creation of compounds like ammonia (NH3) or nitrate (NO3-), which can be used as sources of nitrogen for plants and, in turn, for animals higher up the food chain. So, nitrogen fixation is like the key that unlocks the nitrogen stores in the atmosphere and makes it available for life on Earth.\n\n8.1.1 Industrial Nitrogen Fixation\nIndustrial nitrogen fixation, often referred to as the Haber Process, is a remarkable human-made method to produce ammonium (NH4+) from the nitrogen (N2) in the air. This process was discovered in 1909 by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch. It involves the use of high temperature, high pressure, and an iron catalyst to convert nitrogen gas and hydrogen gas into ammonia. This discovery has had a profound impact on our world. Currently, it provides the basis for roughly half of the world’s population to have enough food, as ammonia is a key component of synthetic fertilizers. However, it’s important to note that this process consumes a significant amount of energy, accounting for around 2% of the world’s energy usage.\nInterestingly, some plants have developed a natural ability to perform nitrogen fixation using bacteria as “factories,” and they can do this under normal atmospheric conditions. This is like having tiny nitrogen-fixing powerhouses within the plant. When you compare the amounts, you’ll find that per year:\n\nBiological nitrogen fixation on land contributes about 90-140 teragrams (Tg, equivalent to 10^12 grams) of nitrogen to ecosystems.\nThe Haber Process contributes approximately 100 Tg of nitrogen globally.\nLightning, through its natural ability to create reactive nitrogen compounds, contributes around 10 Tg of nitrogen.\n\nThese numbers illustrate the remarkable balance between natural and human-driven nitrogen fixation processes that sustain life on Earth, from plant growth to the food we eat."

It’s like having a mini nitrogen factory right at the roots.\nHowever, this incredible process doesn’t come for free. It comes at a cost. To be more specific, it takes about 12 to 17 grams of carbohydrates to produce just one gram of fixed nitrogen. These carbohydrates are the plant’s way of paying for the services of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that reside in the root nodules. In a sense, it’s like giving these bacteria a little snack to motivate them to keep working.\nInterestingly, if legume plants are given nitrogen-based fertilizers, they might decide to skip the whole root nodule formation process. It’s like the plant saying, “Why go through all the trouble of hosting these nitrogen-fixing bacteria if we’re getting our nitrogen from elsewhere?” This ability to suppress nodule formation is a fascinating way that plants can adapt to changing nutrient conditions.\n\n8.2.1 Rhizobia Symbiosis\n\n\n\n\n\nRhizobia Bacteria Under a Microscope\n\n\n\n\nThe partnership between rhizobia bacteria and legume plants is considered one of the most advanced and intricate nitrogen-fixing symbioses in the natural world.\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Nodule and Nodule Formation\n\n\n\n\nThe rhizobia bacteria and legume plant work together in a special way, and it all centers around a unique structure called the nodule. This nodule is essentially a modified root organ that is specially designed to host these endosymbiotic rhizobia bacteria and facilitate nitrogen fixation. It’s like a dedicated factory for producing nitrogen.\nWhen the plant and rhizobia come into contact, something fascinating happens. The rhizobia undergo a transformation, changing into specialized forms called bacteroids. These bacteroids are then enclosed within the plant’s cells, and they reside in a compartment known as the symbiosome. It’s like the plant invites the rhizobia in for a friendly chat and locks them in a cozy room.\nThis symbiosome is enclosed by a specialized membrane called the peribacteroid membrane, which is like the protective barrier around this unique partnership. This well-organized collaboration allows the plant to efficiently obtain the nitrogen it needs, while the rhizobia bacteria have a safe place to work their nitrogen-fixing magic. It’s a sophisticated example of teamwork in the plant world.\n\n\n8.2.2 Plant-Microbe Communication\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Plants Interact with Microbes\n\n\n\n\nCommunication between plants and microbes, like rhizobia, is a fascinating process involving several important steps:\n\nFlavonoid Attraction: It all starts with the plant’s roots. They produce specific compounds called flavonoids. These flavonoids act like a signal to attract the rhizobia bacteria. It’s like the roots are sending out an invitation, saying, “Hey, we’re ready for a guest!”\nNod Factors: In response to the invitation from the plant, most rhizobia bacteria produce something called Nod factors. These Nod factors are specific lipochitooligosaccharides, which are essentially complex molecules. These factors serve as a way for the rhizobia to identify themselves as the right partners for this plant. It’s like presenting a badge at a secure entrance, showing they belong.\nPlant Preparation: When the plant receives the Nod factors and confirms that the rhizobia are the right guests, it starts getting ready to form a symbiotic nodule structure. This structure is like a cozy home where the rhizobia can live and work, creating a beneficial partnership for both the plant and the bacteria. It’s like the plant and the rhizobia are in constant communication, making sure they’re on the same page and ready to work together to fix nitrogen.\n\n\n8.2.2.1 Detecting Nod Signals\n\n\n\n\n\nDetecting Nod Factors in vivo\n\n\n\n\nPlants have a special way of detecting a signal called the “Nod factor.” This signal is like a message from friendly bacteria called rhizobia. It’s how the plant knows when the right guests, the rhizobia, have arrived.\nTo understand this signal, think of it like a lock and key. The plant has special parts called “LysM domains” on proteins named NFR1 and NFR5. These LysM domains act like the keyholes. The Nod factor, which is a part of the rhizobia, is like the key. When the Nod factor fits into these keyholes, it’s like the plant recognizing the right key.\nNow, here’s where the magic begins. LysM domains usually like to stick to carbohydrates. But when they find the Nod factor, it’s like they’ve found something special. This starts a chain reaction, a bit like a domino effect.\nIn this chain reaction, a special protein called SymRK (short for symbiosis receptor kinase) plays a crucial role. Think of SymRK as the conductor of an orchestra. It helps guide the process and makes sure everything goes smoothly. It’s like the plant’s way of saying, “We’re ready to start the show,” and the show is the amazing partnership between the plant and the rhizobia to make nitrogen-fixing nodules.\n\n\n8.2.2.2 Calcium Spiking from Nod Factors\n\n\n\n\n\nCalcium Spiking as a Result of Nod Factors\n\n\n\n\nWhen the plant detects the Nod factor, it triggers something called “Calcium spiking.” This might sound complex, but it’s a common way cells communicate.\nThink of Calcium spiking like a special Morse code between cells. It’s a pattern of signals that tells the cells to get ready for action. Interestingly, this pattern is not unique to plants. Some animals use a similar pattern in their cells for important tasks. One example is the Sonic hedgehog signaling, which might sound familiar if you like superheroes!\nTo make this Calcium spiking happen, the plant needs three important things:\n\nA reservoir of Calcium: Think of this as a storage tank for Calcium ions.\nA channel to release Calcium: This is like opening a gate to let the Calcium ions flow.\nAn energy-dependent Calcium pump: This pump is like a machine that restores the Calcium levels back to where they started, ready for the next signal.\n\n\n\n8.2.2.3 Nodulation Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements for Nodulation\n\n\n\n\nFor nodulation to happen, a specific protein kinase needs to get activated. This kinase is like a conductor that directs the process.\nTo activate this kinase, something called calmodulin comes into play. Calmodulin is a common protein that’s good at binding to calcium, and it’s found in many different organisms. When calmodulin grabs onto calcium, it changes its shape, a bit like how a transformer changes form.\nNow, here’s the teamwork part. Calmodulin teams up with CcaMK (short for calcium-calmodulin-activated protein kinase). Together, they work like a dynamic duo. They’re responsible for turning on the genes that produce nodulin proteins. Nodulins are special proteins that are only found in nodules. They’re like the construction workers of the nodules, doing the specific jobs needed to make this whole process work.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Root Hair Invasion\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot Hair Invasion\n\n\n\n\nWhen rhizobium bacteria want to make themselves at home in a plant’s roots, they start by sending out something called “Nod factors.” Think of these as their way of saying, “We’re here!”\nNow, the plant’s roots are pretty clever. They receive this signal and decide to change things up. The root hairs, which are like tiny hair-like structures on the root’s surface, respond by changing their growth pattern. It’s almost like they’re shifting their shape to trap the bacteria, kind of like creating a cozy little home for them.\nAs the root hairs do this, something interesting begins to happen. An “infection thread” starts forming. This is like a tunnel made of plant cell wall material. And here’s the cool part: it grows from the outside in. It’s as if the plant is constructing a special passage for the bacteria to come in. This way, the bacteria can move deeper into the root, and the plant and bacteria can start their helpful partnership. It’s a bit like building the entrance to a secret underground club for beneficial bacteria!\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Graphics on Root Hair Invasion\n\n\n\n\nThe “infection thread” we talked about earlier doesn’t stop at the front door. It goes further, like a tunnel penetrating several layers of the host plant’s cells. It’s almost like making a highway for the bacteria to travel through the plant’s roots.\nOnce inside, the bacteria are released into special compartments called “symbiosomes.” These compartments are like little rooms, and what’s cool is that their walls are made from the plant itself. It’s like the plant creates cozy, plant-made homes for the bacteria.\nNow, inside these symbiosomes, something really interesting happens. The bacteria start to change and become something called “bacteroids.” Think of it like a superhero transformation!\nTo make these symbiosomes even more special, the plant adds specific proteins to their walls. These proteins are like super useful tools. One of them, for example, acts like an ammonium channel, helping with the flow of nitrogen. Another, called an aquaporin, is like a water channel, making sure there’s enough water for everyone."

    "text": "8.3 Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Phosphorous\n\n8.3.1 Nitrogenase\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  N_2 + 16ATP + 8e^- + 8h^+ \\longrightarrow 2NH_3 + H_2 + 16 ADP + 16 P_i\n\\end{equation}\\]\nNitrogenase is like a special machine, but it’s quite picky. It doesn’t like oxygen, and it only works in certain tiny organisms called prokaryotes (like bacteria).\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction of Nitrogenase Complex\n\n\n\n\nNow, here’s the challenge: making nitrogenase work requires a lot of energy, which is stored in a molecule called ATP. It’s like needing a lot of batteries to power a device.\nBut here’s where it gets interesting. Inside the root nodule, where this whole nitrogen-fixing process is happening, the environment is just right. It’s not too full of oxygen; instead, it’s just a little bit of oxygen, kind of like a sweet spot. And that’s perfect for nitrogenase to do its job and help turn nitrogen gas into a useful form for the plant. It’s like having the ideal conditions for a machine to run smoothly.\n\n\n8.3.2 Making a Low Oxygen Environment\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintaining a Low Oxygen Environment\n\n\n\n\nTo keep the root nodule’s oxygen levels low, there are three clever strategies at play:\n\nBarrier for Oxygen: Imagine the nodule as a fortress. It has a special barrier in the nodule’s tissue that controls the entry of oxygen. How it works exactly is a bit of a mystery, but it’s like a security system that keeps unwanted oxygen from getting inside.\nLeghemoglobin: Legumes have a unique protein called leghemoglobin. This protein is a pro at binding to oxygen. It’s found in high concentrations, kind of like having a lot of sponges to soak up any extra oxygen that might sneak in. Leghemoglobin ensures the oxygen is locked up and doesn’t cause trouble.\nBacterial Oxygen Sink: The bacteria in the nodule are pretty smart too. They use a special tool called “cytochrome oxidase” for their respiration. This tool has a super-low threshold for oxygen. In other words, it grabs onto any oxygen it finds very quickly. This means that the bacteria actually help soak up any oxygen that might be hanging around in the nodule. It’s like having little oxygen-eating machines working alongside the plant.\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Metabolite Exchange\n\n\n\n\n\nMetabolite Exchange in Nature\n\n\n\n\nIn the partnership between the plant and the bacteria in the root nodules, there’s a cool exchange going on. The plant sends over something called photosynthate. This is like the energy it gets from sunlight and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. But instead of sending this energy directly, it first transforms it into special compounds called dicarboxylic acids. These compounds act as a kind of meal for the bacteria, providing them with nourishment.\nNow, it’s the bacteria’s turn to give back. They take these dicarboxylic acids and do something amazing. They use them to create energy (like a power source) called ATP and some important molecules called reducing equivalents. These reducing equivalents are like the magic ingredients needed for the nitrogen-fixing process to work. It’s a bit like the bacteria are cooking up the perfect recipe to help the plant.\nAs a result of all this cooking, the bacteria produce a special substance called ammonia. But the story doesn’t end there. The plant is really clever too. It takes that ammonia and turns it into something called glutamine with the help of an enzyme called glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is like a super-nutrient for the plant.\nNow, the plant can use this new nitrogen-rich glutamine to feed its other parts. It’s a bit like sharing a delicious meal with different members of the plant’s family, making sure everyone gets what they need to grow and thrive.\n\n\n8.3.4 Phosphorous\nPhosphorus is a vital nutrient for plants, kind of like how we need essential vitamins to stay healthy. But there’s a bit of a challenge. The phosphorus plants need is often stuck in the soil, and it’s not very easy for plants to access. It’s like having a valuable treasure buried deep underground.\nTo overcome this, plants have developed some smart strategies. Some plant roots are like little miners. They release substances called carboxylic acids and enzymes known as phosphatases. These work together to make the soil’s phosphorus more accessible to the plant. It’s a bit like having special tools to dig up that buried treasure.\nThe carboxylic acids have a cool trick – they can grab onto metal ions in the soil. These metal ions are like guards, protecting the phosphorus. When the carboxylic acids bind to the metal ions, it’s like they distract the guards, allowing the plant to snatch the phosphorus away from the soil. It’s a bit like a clever heist in the plant world.\nThe phosphatases, on the other hand, are like the plant’s digestion system. They break down organic phosphates, which are like different forms of the treasure, making them easier for the plant to use. So, it’s a two-step process – first, they steal the treasure from the guards, and then they turn it into a form the plant can actually use to grow and thrive. It’s all about being resourceful and efficient in the plant’s quest for phosphorus."

    "text": "8.4 Mycorrhizal Fungi\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of Mycorrhizal Fungi\n\n\n\n\nMycorrhizal fungi are like nature’s friendly helpers for most land plants. These fungi make their home in the roots of plants. It’s almost like they set up camp there.\nThese fungi have super-long, thin threads called hyphae that reach out into the soil. They’re like little explorers on a mission. What they do is pretty cool. They gather water and important minerals, especially something called “Pi” (which is short for phosphate), from the soil. And guess what? They don’t keep all these goodies to themselves. They share them with the plant, kind of like a sharing buddy.\nNow, there are two types of mycorrhizal friendships. One is called “ectomycorrhiza,” where the fungus stays outside the plant cells. It’s like they’re giving the plant a helping hand from the outside.\nThe other type is “endomycorrhiza,” where the fungus goes a step further. It actually goes inside the plant cells. It’s like inviting a friend into your house.\nBut the most common and popular type of mycorrhiza is called “arbuscular mycorrhiza.” In this one, the fungi create tree-like structures called “arbuscules” right inside the plant cells. It’s like having little forests inside the plant.\nThese fungi are so good at what they do that the mass of their tiny threads, called mycelium, can be as big as the plant’s own roots. It’s like having a whole team of helpers making sure the plant gets all the water and minerals it needs.\n\n8.4.1 Communicating Between Fungi and Plants\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps of Communication Between Fungi and Plants\n\n\n\n\nPlants and fungi have their own secret language to talk to each other. Here’s how they do it:\n\nThe plant’s roots send out special signals called “strigolactones” and other chemical messages. These signals tell the fungal hyphae (those long, thin threads of the fungus) to start branching out. It’s like the plant is saying, “Hey, we’re ready for you to join us!”\nThe fungi have their own way of talking back. They produce something called “Myc factors,” which are a fancy name for lipochitooligosaccharides (or LCOs for short). This is like their way of saying, “We’re here to help, and we’re friendly!”\nThe plant, in response, gets ready to let the fungi inside its cells. It’s like opening the door and inviting your friends over for a visit. The plant knows that these fungi are here to team up and work together.\n\n\n8.4.1.1 Regulating Myc Factors\n\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing Myc Factors\n\n\n\n\nRecognizing Myc factors is a bit like finding a friend in a crowd. We’re not exactly sure how it works, but it’s kind of similar to how the plant recognizes Nod factors, which are signals from bacteria. There are some special receptors involved, but we don’t know exactly what they are yet. It’s a bit of a mystery!\nJust like in the Nod factor recognition, a protein called SymRK is also needed to make this recognition process happen. It’s like having a key to unlock the secret message.\nWhen the plant and the fungi successfully recognize each other, it sets off a little “calcium spiking” signal. It’s like a secret handshake that tells them, “We’re good to go, let’s work together!”\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Considering Evolutionary and Agricultural Aspects\n\n\n\n\n\nClose Up of a Fossil\n\n\n\n\nThe friendship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi has been around for a super long time, like way before our grandparents were born. It’s like an ancient and widespread tradition in the plant world. In fact, most plants have the special tools needed to make this friendship happen.\nNow, here’s something really fascinating. The partnership between plants and rhizobium bacteria, which helps with nitrogen, actually evolved from the machinery used in mycorrhizal friendships. It’s like taking something old and making it even better. So, in the future, when we understand all the details, we might be able to introduce this nitrogen-fixing ability into even more plant species. That would be a game-changer for farming and agriculture, like having a superpower for growing food!"

    "text": "8.5 Bad Microbial Interactions\nYou know how sometimes people get sick, and it’s not fun at all? Well, plants have their own version of that. Some tiny pests and pathogens, like little plant invaders, can make plants really sick.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Negative Interactions with Plant Microbes\n\n\n\n\nThis is a big problem for farmers. Imagine if a lot of the food we grow got ruined by these plant-sickness-causing pests and germs. It would be like having less food to eat.\nThere are some famous examples of this. Back in 1840, there was something called the “Irish potato famine,” and it was caused by a nasty microorganism called “oomycete.” It wiped out a lot of potato crops, and that’s a big deal because potatoes are a major food source.\nThere’s also the story of the “black stem rust.” In the 1950s, this bad guy messed with the North American wheat crops, and it was a disaster. Wheat is used to make things like bread, and when the crops got sick, it affected what people could eat.\n\n8.5.1 Kinds of Pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\nKinds of Plant Pathogens\n\n\n\n\nPathogens are like the “bad guys” that can make plants sick, but they come in different types:\n\nNecrotrophs are like plant bullies. They first kill the plant’s cells and then eat what’s left. It’s kind of like breaking a toy and then playing with the broken pieces.\nBiotrophs are more like plant squatters. They live inside the plant’s tissue, sort of like making a home there. But the interesting thing is, they don’t cause the plant’s death. It’s like having a roommate who doesn’t kick you out of your own house.\nHemibiotrophs are like shape-shifters. They can switch between being a friendly guest (biotroph) and turning into a plant bully (necrotroph). It’s like someone who can be nice one day and mean the next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant Invasion via Natural Openings\n\n\n\n\nWhen a microbe infects a plant, it can do so via an opening.\n\n\n8.5.2 Psueodmonas syringae\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudomonas Bacteria at Work\n\n\n\n\nImagine there’s a sneaky, hemibiotrophic bacterium called Pseudomonas syringae, and it plays a trick on some plant friends.\nThese bacteria make their home in the spaces between plant cells. You can see them because they light up with green and red colors, kind of like glow-in-the-dark toys.\nNow, when these bacteria grow in number, they do something interesting. They use a special way (i.e., quorum sensing) to talk to each other, like having a secret code. When they’re all talking together, they switch into a “mean” mode. This means they start making things that can hurt the plant, like enzymes that break down the plant’s cell walls and other tricky molecules.\n\n\n8.5.3 Biotrophic Fungi Strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nBiotrophic Fungi Diagrams and Closeups\n\n\n\n\nSo, here’s how some sneaky fungi work when they want to live inside a plant:\n\nThese fungi have a special trick up their sleeves. They make something called an “appressorium” to break through the plant’s protective wall. It’s like they create a tiny battering ram to get inside.\nOnce they’re inside, they form something called a “haustorium.” It’s like a cozy room they build within the plant cell. They even put up their own walls by making a special membrane.\nThe haustorium is like a super-efficient kitchen. It helps the fungus get more nutrients and water from the plant. It’s all about making the plant’s resources flow to the fungus, so it can grow and live happily inside.\n\n\n\n8.5.4 PAMPS\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of PAMPS\n\n\n\n\nWhen a plant wants to spot a sneaky pathogen, it uses something like a secret code. This code is called “Pathogen-associated molecular patterns,” or PAMPS for short.\nNow, PAMPS are like tiny clues that give away the pathogen’s presence. They’re a bit like leaving behind fingerprints at a crime scene. Only a few pairs of these codes and the plant’s “spotter” (we call it a PRR) have been discovered. It’s like finding a few secret handshakes that help the plant recognize the bad guys.\n\n8.5.4.1 PAMP Recognition\n\n\n\n\n\nPAMP Recognition\n\n\n\n\nPlants have special sensors to detect when something is wrong, kind of like an alarm system.\nOne of these sensors is called WAK1. It’s like a guard that watches out for pieces of the plant’s own cell wall. When it spots these fragments, it knows something is not right.\nAnother sensor is DORN1. It’s like a security camera that keeps an eye on something called extracellular ATP. This ATP is a sign that there might be damage to plant cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern Triggered Immunity\n\n\n\n\nThe above leads to the development of something called a pattern triggered immunity (i.e., PTI).\n\n\n8.5.4.2 Recognitions of Symbionts\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Symbionts\n\n\n\n\nIt’s like finding similarities between two superhero teams.\nIn one team, there’s a superhero called CERK1, and in another team, there’s a hero called NFR1. These heroes are kind of like cousins because they have a family connection, meaning they come from a similar background.\nNow, both CERK1 and NFR1 have a special power called a “kinase.” This power helps them do important jobs. In one team, they use this power for defense, like protecting their team from bad guys. This is a really old and important job.\n\n\n\n8.5.5 Making Reactive Oxygen Species (i.e., ROS)\n\n\n\n\n\nForming Reactive Oxygen Species in Plants\n\n\n\n\nPlants have a secret weapon called ROS. It’s like their very own superhero.\nWhen there’s trouble, ROS goes to work. It fights off bad guys like germs, and it also sends out signals to warn the plant that something’s wrong. It’s a bit like a security alarm that alerts the plant to danger.\nROS doesn’t stop there. It also helps the plant build up special compounds that can kill off the bad guys, kind of like plant bodyguards. Plus, it reinforces the plant’s walls to make it harder for the bad guys to get in.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffector Proteins Suppressing ROS Production\n\n\n\n\nWhen bad pathogens invade a plant, they have sneaky tricks up their sleeves. These tricks are like secret weapons.\nOne of these weapons is called an “effector.” Pathogens use effectors to mess with the plant’s defense system. It’s like a spy who goes inside the plant’s cells and tries to sabotage their protection.\nThese effectors are like little tools that the pathogen uses to make itself stronger and healthier. They might do things to stop the plant from fighting back, like interfering with the plant’s immune response.\n\n8.5.5.1 Examples of Effectors\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Effectors Against ROS Production\n\n\n\n\nImagine the bad pathogens have different tools in their toolbox to mess with the plant. Here are a few examples:\n\nOne tool, called Hop1, is used by a germ called Pseudomonas syringae. It’s like a tool that breaks the plant’s chloroplasts, which are important for plant energy. This makes the plant weak.\nAnother tool, known as AvrBs3, is used by a germ called Xanthomonas campestris. It’s like a tool that turns on certain genes in the plant. These genes help the germ survive and grow, making it more dangerous.\nAvrPto is like a special tool from Pseudomonas syringae. It goes after something called FLS2, which is like a plant’s alarm system. This tool messes up the alarm so the plant can’t signal for help.\nThen there’s Avr2, which is a tool that stops something called cysteine proteases. These proteases help the plant fight off the bad germs, so when Avr2 is used, the plant’s defenses become weaker."

    "text": "8.6 Effector-Triggered Immunity (i.e., ETI)\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of an ETI\n\n\n\n\nWhen bad germs use their tricky tools (effectors) to mess with a plant, the plant has its own secret defense plan called “Effector-triggered immunity” or ETI. It’s like the plant’s superhero power.\nIn this defense plan, the plant has special genes (called “R” genes) that can recognize specific bad germ effectors. It’s like having a superhero radar that spots the enemy.\nBut here’s the catch: If either the specific effector or the superhero gene is missing, the plant’s immunity plan won’t work. It’s like Batman needing both his gadgets and his bat-suit to fight crime.\nThis plan works well for most plant germs that live inside the plant (biotrophic germs). And plant scientists can use this superhero power to make plants stronger by adding the R genes from wild plant relatives into the plants we grow in our gardens. It’s like giving our plants extra superpowers to fight off the bad germs.\n\n8.6.1 R-Proteins and PRRs\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of R-Proteins and PRRs\n\n\n\n\nIn plants, there are special proteins that help with recognizing and fighting off bad germs. These proteins have a unique part called “leucine-rich repeats” or LRR motifs.\nThink of LRR motifs like puzzle pieces that plants use to connect with other proteins. When the pieces fit together, it’s like a handshake between proteins.\nWhat’s really cool is that even a tiny change in one piece can create a completely different handshake. These handshakes are how proteins talk to each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree Ways to Recognize R Proteins\n\n\n\n\nR-proteins act like guards against harmful invaders. These R-proteins have different ways to spot the bad guys.\n\nDirect Recognition: Sometimes, the R-protein can see the invader directly, like looking at a wanted poster and saying, “I found you!”\nGuard or Decoy: In other cases, the invader tries to change one of the R-protein’s friends. When the R-protein sees this change, it knows something’s wrong and sounds the alarm.\nBait: There are also times when the invader teams up with something else. The R-protein notices this partnership and knows there’s trouble."
