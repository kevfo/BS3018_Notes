Second, they’re useful for studying development and other processes. Third, by looking at plants, one can understand things from genes to whole communities. Lastly, plants matter a lot.\nIn this lecture, there are some important words to remember:\nPlants are incredibly important because life wouldn’t be possible without them. They provide us with essential things we need to survive. Imagine staple foods like rice, wheat, corn, and potatoes – these come from plants and make up a big part of our diets. Even things like fruits, herbs, and spices, like chili, coffee, and chocolate, all come from different types of plants. Each of these plants contributes to the foods we eat and enjoy.\nNowadays, people are getting more worried about having enough food for everyone. That’s why understanding plant biology is super important now. It helps us make sure there’s enough food for everyone.\nIn this week’s session, we’re going to learn about a few things:"

    "section": "1.1 What is a Plant?",
    "text": "1.1 What is a Plant?\nWhen we look at living things, it’s normal to put them into groups based on the things they have in common. People have always done this. In the case of plants, this grouping is called taxonomy. Traditionally, plants were sorted into groups based on what they looked like and how they were different from each other.\nNonetheless, for a long time, scientists have looked at specific traits to understand what makes something a plant. These traits have taught us a couple of important things about plants:\n\nPlants are organisms that use a process called photosynthesis to make their own food. This sets them apart from many other living things.\nThey have a special way of life that involves different stages in their cycle. Sometimes they have a part that’s like a “baby” version (called gametophyte) and another part that’s more grown-up (called sporophyte). This alternation between these two stages is a big part of what makes plants unique.\n\nAs scientists have discovered more about different living things, they’ve had to rethink how they define plants. Organisms that were once thought to belong only to the “Plant Kingdom” have been moved to their own groups, like Fungi. This is because we now know more about their characteristics.\nThe way scientists sort living things has also changed over time. It started with a simple “Two Kingdom” idea, where there were just Plants and Animals. Then it grew to a “Five Kingdom” idea, adding Fungi, Protists, and Bacteria. Now, things have evolved even more into the concept of “Three Domains”: Eukaryota, Archaea, and Bacteria. But what’s really important is that the way scientists classify living things has shifted. Instead of just looking at how things appear, they now focus a lot on the relationships between organisms and how they’ve evolved. This new way of sorting is all about understanding the family tree of life.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogeny of Plants\n\n\n\n\nDefining plants can be a bit tricky. Some people think of plants as organisms that can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. They also have a special kind of life cycle called “alternation of generations.” However, not every organism with these features belongs to the same group on the tree of life as plants do.\nIn this course, the focus is narrowed down. They will be looking specifically at “green plants.” And to be even more precise, they’ll be studying “Land Plants,” which are also known as “Embryophytes.” These are the plants that live on land and have certain characteristics that set them apart.\n\n1.1.1 Phylogeny versus Classification\nPhylogeny is about showing how different living things are related to each other. It’s like drawing a family tree that connects all the creatures. These family trees not only tell us about relationships but also give clues about the history and environment of different groups of organisms. Plus, they show how organisms have changed over time to fit their surroundings better.\nClassification, on the other hand, is more about giving names and organizing the incredible variety of life. It’s like putting different things into different boxes based on how they look or behave.\nNow, when it comes to plants, their phylogeny helps experts decide how to classify them. By understanding the connections between different plant groups, scientists can figure out the best way to group and name them. It’s like solving a puzzle where the pieces are the relationships between plants.\nIf a plant flowers, it’s called a angiosperm. Otherwise, it’s a gymnosperm."

Moving towards the right, there are filamentous organisms, which are like chains of cells. And on the far right, there’s something called “coenocytic.” This means it’s a big organism with many nuclei, or control centers, inside it. Unlike most organisms that have individual cells, this one doesn’t have clear divisions between its cells inside.\n\n\n1.2.2 Locophytes\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of a Locophyte\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Gingko Tree\n\n\n\n\n\nCloseup of a Gingko Tree’s Seeds\n\n\n\n\nTalking about the Ginkgo, there’s just one type that exists now, called Ginkgo biloba.

Instead, it creates something called spores. These spores are not the same as gametes.\nThese spores grow into a plant that can make gametes. This plant generation is called the gametophyte.\nWhen gametes from different plants come together, they make a cell with two sets again (2N). This cell, called a zygote, then grows into a different kind of plant, the sporophyte, which produces spores.\nSo, in plants, the cycle goes from spores to gametophyte to zygote to Sporophyte and back again. It’s a bit different from what happens in animals."

However, they are responsible for performing metabolism within the plant.\nCollenchyma\n\n\n\n\n\nStructure of Lignin\n\n\n\n\nThese cells are found in primary tissue, but their cell walls are made of a kind of sugar called cellulose (i.e., not lignin). Cells with a lignified xylem (e.g., fiber and sclerenchyma cells) are usually associated with secondary (and some primary) tissues.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Bundle of Celery\n\n\n\n\nAs an example, celery leaves are held up by the celery itself which is made out of collenchyma cells.\n\n\n2.2.1 Silver Cells\nThese are cells that basically move photosynthate (e.g., sugars and whatnot) and are made up of two things: sieve cells and companion cells.\n\n\n2.2.2 Conducting and Vascular Tissue\nThese tissues serve to move water (i.e., the xylem) and other items (i.e., the phloem) around the plant, and each tissue type serves multiple functions.\n\n2.2.2.1 Xylem\nThis tissue is actually made up of many different cells and are entirely made out of dead cells when in its later stages (i.e., when the xylem reaches “maturity”).\nThe xylem also forms one continuous column from the plant’s roots to its leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Types of Cells in the Xylem\n\n\n\n\nThe cells that move water throughout the xylem (i.e., the conducting cells) have two kinds:\n\nTracheids\nThese are narrow cells with tapered ends. All plants that have vascular systems have this.\nVessels\nThese are found in most, but not all flowering plants. These kinds of cells have a larger diameter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Helianthus Stem\n\n\n\n\nWhen the xylem thickens, it’s mainly because of the secondary xylem (i.e., wood). It grows because of thet vascular cambium.\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Other Tissue and Cell Types\nProf. Lum lists some more:\n\nThe bark - this is also called the periderm.\nSclerenchyma - these are made out of something called linear fibers.\nLenticels - these cells exchange air in shoot and root surfaces.\nTrichomes - these are hair-like projections that grow out of the epidermis."

Instead, they show vessel-like elements.\n\n2.3.1 Vascular Tissue in Monocots versus Dicots\nDicotyledonous plants (i.e., dicots) are plants whose seeds have embryos with two things called cotyledons or seedling leaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Monocot Stem\n\n\n\n\nMonocotyledonous plants (i.e., monocots), on the contrary, are plants whose seeds have embryos that only have one cotyledon.\nDicot stems have a ring-like formation because of how their vascular tissue are arranged, whereas monocot stems are more scattered.\n\n\n2.3.2 Leaves\nThese plant organs have a stomata and an epidermis, layers, a vascular system (i.e., phloem and xylem), and may even have special layers to them. There’s also a ton of variation among leaves in terms of their shape and function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStoma and Guard Cell of a Tomato Plant’s Leaves\n\n\n\n\nThe epidermis is just the outer layer of plant tissues (i.e., kinda like the outer layer of skin on humans). The stoma - on the other hand - are just the pores in the epidermis of tissues that conduct photosynthesis. The stoma has two cells: a pair of guard cells that are surrounded by subsidiary cells.\n\n2.3.2.1 Venation and Stomata Distribution\nThe organization of vascular tissue and the distribution of stomata differs between monocots and dicots in the following ways:\n\nLeaves in dicot plants have veins that are net-like. Leaves in monocot leaves have veisn that are in parallel structures.\nDifferent stomata distribution patterns reflect the fact that venation is different in monocots and dicots.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Roots versus Shoots\nRoots and shoots differ in terms of how their vascular tissues are arranged. In root tissue, the vascular tissue have protective layers - like an endodermis and a root cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Section of a Buttercup’s Root\n\n\n\n\nHowever, root and shoot tissue have something called a zone of maturation. The xylem and the phloem alternate in root tissue (as seen above).\n\n2.3.3.1 Modified Roots\n\n\n\n\n\nModified Roots in a Freshwater Swamp Forest\n\n\n\n\nThese are roots that have been modified to serve a specific purpose other than just anchoring the plant to the ground. The above tree from a swamp is an example."

The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving…”\n– Charles Darwin\n\nIt was through these ideas that he founded the idea of natural selection - in a nutshell, these are:\n\nIndividuals vary\nSome of these variations in 1. are rooted in genetics.\nThere’s a tendency for the population of a species to grow exponentially.\nThese variations in 1. may affect the ability of individuals to survive - this is called their fitness: their ability to survive and reproduce.\nIndividuals that have favorable variations are live and reproduce - we say that these individuals are naturally selected.\n\nFor the man himself, Ecology was the meat of his natural selection idea. If there was nothing that to make surviving difficult, then there would be no reason for individuals to have different fitnesses and therefore, also nothing to make natural selection happen."

This absorbed energy is then relayed to where photosynthesis actually occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nTwo pigments - chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b - are used to capture light in photosynthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nLight Harvesting Complexes in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nAt least in the memrbane protein LHCII, the said pigments are arranged into a sort of antennae. Scientists think that each 25 kDa protein above binds 14 chlorophylls and also four things called xanthophylls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessory Light-Capturing Pigments in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nSometimes, pigments called accessory pigments can help pick up light that are otherwise not absorbed by chlorophyll. Because of this, photosynthesis is able to become more efficient as these pigments can also transmit the energy to where photosynthesis happens.\nThe cool thing about these pigments too is that they help protect organisms against intense or damaging sunlight.\n\n4.2.1.1 Absorbing Light\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Light Absorption Works\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is absorbed, this causes a molecule to become “excited” and go to a higher energy state.\nThe difference between this “excited” and normal state is referred to as \\(\\Delta E\\) - the difference can be calculated using:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta E = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWhere \\(h\\) is Planck’s constant, \\(c\\) is the speed of light, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light absorbed.\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Energy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Levels in the Chlorophyll\n\n\n\n\nWhen an electron is excited inside the chlorophyll, the following actions can happen:\n\nFluorescence\nHere, an excited electron releases a photon and returns to its original state.\nReturning to the Ground State\nWhen this happens, energy that the electron has is lost as heat to the environment.\nEnergy Transfer\nThe energy that was lost as heat is then taken up by another electron\nPhotochemistry\nThis loss in energy causes chemical reactions to happen.\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Where is Light Absorbed?\n\n\n\n\n\nLocations of Light Absorption\n\n\n\n\nWhen light is captured, it is captured on the antennae before this light energy is sent to the reaction centers.\nProf. Oliver also lists a few terminology:\n\nPhotosystem\nThis is a structure that is made out of a reaction center (i.e., RC) and an antenna or light harvesting complex.\nReaction Center (i.e., RC)\nThese help convert light energy turn into chemical energy. These are also just protein bits (i.e., subunits) that have things called cofactors attached to them that are found in the middle of the photosystem.\nAntenna or light harvesting complexes\nThese structures have chlorophyll and other accessory pigments; they surround the RC and help absorb light and sent it to the RC.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Charge Separation\nOnce pigments absorb energy, this energy needs to be sent over in a way called resonance energy transfer. What this basically means is that after the light energy goes from the antennae to the reaction center, an electron is transferred over to the membrane and to a donor, and this causes something called photoinduced charge separation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharge Separation in Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThe only reason this is possible is because electron transfer is a lot faster (i.e, 3 ps).\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent Kinds of Photosystems in Oxygenic Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nThat said, there are also two kinds of photosystems in oxygenic photosystems. These two kinds of photosystems are related to the way that prokaryotes perform anoxygenic photosynthesis.\n\n\n4.2.3 Electron Transfer\nThis step moves electrons across a chain to do two things: to make a proton motive force and to also make NADPH.\nAll electron transfer reactions involve something called oxidation reduction reactions. In the case of the equation for photosynthesis:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  6CO_2 + 12H_2O \\stackrel{\\text{light}}{\\longrightarrow} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe reducer (i.e., reducing species) is the water molecule H2O and one to become oxidized is the carbon dioxide (i.e., the CO2).\nWe use the symbol \\(\\Delta G\\) to illustrate the tendency of redox reactions to proceed. This symbol is also called the free energy.\n\n4.2.3.1 Free Energy and Redox Potentials\nThe value of \\(\\Delta G\\) is given by the following equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n  \\Delta G = -nF\\Delta E^\\theta\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe higher the potential that something has, this means that it is a great reducing agent. This also means that this something also has a greater tendency to accept electrons (and vice versa).\nHence, electrons will willing flow from substances with low tendencies to accept electrons to substances with high tendencies for electrons."

In doing so, something else called a proton motive force (i.e., PMF) is made, and this PMF is used to make ATP.\nCyclic electron flow\nThe electrons that came from the water molecule (that were obtained using light energy) stay in the system, but its energy is used to pump protons to make the PMF. This causes ATP to be made.\nIn this sort of electron flow, electrons flow from ferredoxin back to the plastoquinone pool and only do so to produce ATP.\nThis sort of electron flow helps the cell adjust the ratio of NADPH and ATP according to its requirements.\n\n\n4.3.1 Why Two Kinds of Photosystems in Photosynthesis?\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Kinds of Photosystems in Oxygenic Photosynthesis\n\n\n\n\nIn the second photosystem - PSII - there is a strong oxidant and a weak reductant that is able to split water into oxygen gas to also get the electrons.\nHowever, in the first photosytem - PSI - there is a stable reductant (that can turn NADP+ into NADPH) and a weak oxidant.\n\n4.3.1.1 Photosystem II\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PSII Complex’s Structure\n\n\n\n\nThe PSII does a pretty important job - it splits water to produce O2 gas and also transfers electrons to something called a plastoquinone (i.e., PQ) pool.\nThe reaction center is called P680 and it’s found in the reaction center of the PSII photosystem. The oxidized form of P680 - P680+ - is the most oxidizing molecule in Biology.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Producing Oxygen\n\n\n\n\n\nSite of Oxygen Gas Production\n\n\n\n\nThis happens in the Mn4CaO5 cluster that’s found on the lumen side of the thylakoid’s membranes. The managnese atom in the middle of the complex helps accumulates negative charges.\n\n\n4.3.3 Z-Scheme in the Membranes\n\n\n\n\n\nZ-Scheme in the Membranes\n\n\n\n\nThe proton motive force (i.e., PMF) is made using a series of reductions and oxidations. This PMF is also used to make ATP using an enzyme called chloroplast APT synthase."
